 abstract     = {Extensive research has been done on planning for single-agent problems, but multi-agent planning has not as yet been thoroughly explored in agent development platforms. These platforms typically provide various mechanisms for runtime coordination, which are often useful in online planning. In this context decentralised multi-agent planning can be efficient as well as effective, especially in loosely-coupled domains, whilst also ensuring important properties in agent systems such as privacy and autonomy. In this paper, we describe the DOMAP planning framework and its integration with a multi-agent programming platform to support the achievement of social goals. Our planning framework has separate phases for goal allocation and individual HTN planning, whilst relying on available runtime coordination. Experiments on three different multi-agent systems implemented in JaCaMo show that DOMAP outperforms four other state-of-the-art multi-agent planners with regards to both planning and execution time.},

 abstract     = {Multi-agent systems (MAS) have long been envisioned as a key enabling technology in manufacturing, but this promise is yet to be realized: the lack of proper models, architectures, tooling, and the high level of expertise required for designing and programming agent-based manufacturing systems have hindered their large-scale acceptance. The emerging Web of Things (WoT), now being standardized at the W3C and IETF, provides new research opportunities that could help MAS enter the mainstream. In this paper, we present an approach to design scalable and flexible agent-based manufacturing systems that integrates automated planning with multi-agent oriented programming for the WoT: autonomous agents synthesize production plans using semantic descriptions of Web-based artifacts and coordinate with one another via multi-agent organizations; engineers can program and repurpose the systems on the fly via an intuitive Web user interface. The systems use the Web as an application architecture (and not just as a transport layer), which facilitates the seamless integration of geographically distributed production cells. To demonstrate our approach, we implemented a prototypical production cell that uses industry-grade robots and an augmented reality interface for human workers. Together, these contributions demonstrate a means to achieve an intriguing vision for the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution: a global collective intelligence for manufacturing.},

 abstract     = {Argumentation-based reasoning plays an important role in agent reasoning and communication. In this work, we extend an argumentation-based reasoning mechanism to take into account preferences over arguments supporting contrary conclusions. Such preferences come from elements that are present or can be more easily obtained in the context of practical multi-agent programming platforms, such as multiple sources from which the information (used to construct the arguments) was acquired, as well as varying degrees of trust on them. Further, we introduce different agent profiles by varying the way certain operators are applied over the various information sources. Unlike previous approaches, our approach accounts for multiple sources for a single piece of information and is based on an argumentation-based reasoning mechanism implemented on a multi-agent platform.},

 abstract     = {"Agents and Artifacts" (A&amp;A) and CARTAGO are becoming increasingly popular as, respectively, a general-purpose programming model and a related infrastructure for developing shared computational environments in agent-based software systems. However, so far there has been no work on developing multiagent systems (MAS) where agents implemented and deployed in different agent-programming platforms can interact as part of the same MAS with a shared environment. Due to the generality of CARTAGO environments and its Java-based implementation, we have successfully implemented an open multi-agent system where heterogeneous agents developed with different platforms---namely Jason, 2APL as BDI-based approaches and simpA as an activity-oriented approach rather than BDI-based---work together in shared workspaces where they interact and cooperate by dynamically creating and using shared artifacts, analogously to human working environments. This paper shows how this was achieved by first presenting a general model for incorporating a theory of use and observation of artifacts in cognitive agents, then describing a general approach for developing such heterogeneous MAS using CARTAGO integrated with existing agent-oriented programming platforms.},
