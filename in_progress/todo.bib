 abstract     = {This thesis explores the uses of a multi-agent system(MAS) for procedural content generation(PCG) in the Generative Design in Minecraft (GDMC) competition. The generatorconstructed is capable of surveying the terrain and determining where to start building a roadnetwork. Extendor and connector agents build the road network used for the settlement. Aplotting agent surveys the area around the created roads for plots appropriate for buildinghouses. A house building agent then generates basic buildings on these plots. Finally afurniture agent places furniture in these buildings. The result of the thesis shows that thegenerator is capable of generating an interesting road network that is appropriate to its terrain.The buildings have potential but are lacking in form of adaptability to the current biome andbuildings are overall too similar to be interesting, causing it to get low scores in the userstudy and competition. The generator was entered to the GDMC-competition in 2021 where itplaced 17th of 20th place.},
