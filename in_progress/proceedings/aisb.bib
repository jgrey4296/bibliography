 abstract     = {Emotional argumentation is the result of a rational form of reasoning by the Persuader, subsequently translated into messages by applying some variants of the classical argumentation schemes. In this paper, we discuss which may be assumed to be the relative strength of emotional vs. rational persuasion strategies and how this has been represented in a dialogic persuasion testbed.},

The main goal of this work is to develop artificial creatures, controlled by cognitive architectures, with different levels of machine consciousness.

The triune brain theory proposed by MacLean and also Arrabale‟s ConsScale will serve as roadmaps to achieve each developmental stage, while iCub - a humanoid robot and its simulator - will serve as a platform for the experiments.
