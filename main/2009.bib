 abstract     = {Multi-agent systems where the members are developed by parties with competing interests, and where there is no access to a member's internal state, are often classified as 'open'. The specification of protocols for open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a design-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification modification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is often required to revise the specification during the protocol execution. To address this requirement, we present an infrastructure for 'dynamic' protocol specifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at runtime by agents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a modification of the 'rules of the game' as well as decision-making over and enactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule modification by modelling dynamic specifications as metric spaces. Furthermore, we constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation criteria. We illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a resourcesharing protocol, and an execution of this protocol in which the participating agents modify the protocol specification.},

Key characteristics of such societies are agent heterogeneity, conflicting individual goals and unpredictable behavior. Members of such societies may fail to, or even choose not to, conform to the norms governing their interactions. It has been argued that systems of this type should have a formal, declarative, verifiable, and meaningful semantics. We present a theoretical and computational framework being developed for the executable specification of open agent societies. We adopt an external perspective and view societies as instances of normative systems. In this article, we demonstrate how the frame- work can be applied to specifying and executing a contract-net protocol. The specification is formalized in two action languages, the C+ language and the Event Calculus, and executed using respective software implementations, the Causal Calculator and the Society Visualizer. We evaluate our executable specification in the light of the presented case study, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the employed action languages for the specification of open agent societies.},

 abstract     = {The ability of autistic children to learn by applying logical rules has been used widely in behavioral therapies for social training. We propose to teach social skills to autistic children through games that simultaneously stimulate social behavior and include recognition of elements of social interaction. For this purpose we created a multi-agent platform of interactive blocks, and we created appropriate games that require shared activities leading to a common goal. The games included perceiving and understanding elements of social behavior that non-autistic children can recognize. We argue that the importance of elements of social interaction such as perceiving interaction behaviors and assigning metaphoric meanings has been overlooked, and that they are very important in the social training of autistic children. Two games were compared by testing them with users. The first game focused only on the interaction between the agents and the other combined interaction between the agents and metaphoric meanings that are assigned to them. The results show that most of the children recognized the patterns of interaction as well as the metaphors when they were demonstrated through embodied agents and were included within games having features that engage the interest of this user group. The results also show the potential of the platform and the games to influence the social behavior of the children positively.},

Researchers investigated central representations of body parts and actions involving these, but neglected the global and unitary character of self-consciousness, the 'I' of experience and behaviour. We ask, what are the minimally sufficient conditions for the appearance of a phenomenal self, that is, the fundamental conscious experience of being someone? What are necessary conditions for self-consciousness in any type of system? We offer conceptual clarifications, discuss recent empirical evidence from neurology and cognitive science and argue that these findings offer a new entry point for the systematic study of global and more fundamental aspects of self-consciousness. ©2008 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract     = {In order to behave intelligently, artificial agents must be able to deliberatively plan their future actions. Unfortunately, realistic agent environments are usually highly dynamic and only partially observable, which makes planning computationally hard. For most practical purposes this rules out planning techniques that account for all possible con- tingencies in the planning process. However, many agent environments permit an alternative approach, namely continual planning, i.e. the interleaving of planning with acting and sens- ing. This paper presents a new principled approach to continual planning that describes why andwhen an agent should switch between planning and acting. The resulting continual plan- ning algorithm enables agents to deliberately postpone parts of their planning process and instead actively gather missing information that is relevant for the later refinement of the plan. To this end, the algorithm explictly reasons about the knowledge (or lack thereof) of an agent and its sensory capabilities. These concepts are modelled in the planning language (MAPL). Since in many environments the major reason for dynamism is the behaviour of other agents, MAPL can also model multiagent environments, common knowledge among agents, and communicative actions between them. For Continual Planning, MAPL intro- duces the concept of of assertions, abstract actions that substitute yet unformed subplans. To evaluate our continual planning approach empirically we have developed MAPSIM, a sim- ulation environment that automatically builds multiagent simulations from formal MAPL domains. Thus, agents can not only plan, but also execute their plans, perceive their envi- ronment, and interact with each other. Our experiments show that, using continual planning techniques, deliberate action planning can be used efficiently even in complex multiagent environments.},

Although relationships formed in virtual worlds have invited a lot of recent interest, surprisingly little work has been done on developing computer agents and non-player characters that can actively participate in such relationships. The focus of this review is relational agents, agents that can build long term socio-emotional relationships with users. In virtual worlds, such agents are just starting to emerge; they are more common in other environments but remain few and far between. This review critically assesses the progress of relational agent development and research since their inception in 2005, proposes new areas of research and considers the potential for their exploitation in virtual worlds.},

 abstract     = {Norms and social laws are one of the key mechanisms used to facilitate coordination in multiagent systems. In existing approaches the process of designing useful norms has to either be performed by a human expert, or requires a full enumeration of the state space which is bound to cause tractability problems in non-trivial domains. In this paper we propose a novel automated synthesis procedure for prohibitive norms in planning-based domains that disallow access to a set of predefined undesirable states. Our method performs local search around declarative specifications of states using AI planning methods. Using this approach, norms can be syn- Thcsised in a generalised way over incomplete state specifications to improve the efficiency of the process in many practical cases, while producing concise, generalised, social norms that are applicable to entire sets of system states. Wc present an algorithm that utilises traditional planning techniques to ensure continued accessibility under the prohibitions introduced by norms. An analysis of the computational properties of our algorithm is presented together with a discussion of possible heuristic improvements.

 abstract     = {How can Wii Sports teach us about metaphysics? Can playing World of Warcraft lead to greater self-consciousness? How can we learn about aesthetics, ethics and divine attributes from Zork, Grand Theft Auto, and Civilization? A variety of increasingly sophisticated video games are rapidly overtaking books, films, and television as America's most popular form of media entertainment. It is estimated that by 2011 over 30 percent of US households will own a Wii console - about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953. In Philosophy Through Video Games, Jon Cogburn and Mark Silcox - philosophers with game industry experience - investigate the aesthetic appeal of video games, their effect on our morals, the insights they give us into our understanding of perceptual knowledge, personal identity, artificial intelligence, and the very meaning of life itself, arguing that video games are popular precisely because they engage with longstanding philosophical problems. Topics covered include: The Problem of the External World Dualism and Personal Identity Artificial and Human Intelligence in the Philosophy of Mind The Idea of Interactive Art The Moral Effects of Video Games Games and God's Goodness Games discussed include: Madden Football, Wii Sports, Guitar Hero, World of Warcraft, Sims Online, Second Life, Baldur's Gate, Knights of the Old Republic, Elder Scrolls, Zork, EverQuest Doom, Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto, Civilization, Mortal Kombat, Rome: Total War, Black and White, Aidyn Chronicles Paperback: 202 pages Publisher: Routledge; 1 edition (December 23, 2008) Language: English},

 abstract     = {The characteristic urban experience of solitude challenges traditional anthropological theories of urban life. This article surveys urban theories that treat solitude primarily as loneliness, anomie, and social disorder. It then challenges these theoretical perspectives with ethnographic cases of gay identities and “being alone together,” drawn from fieldwork in New Delhi, India. I develop a heuristic concept of “social solitude” in contrast to ”solidarity,” and examine the political and philosophical consequences of focusing on solitude as an urban way of life and an expression of sexuality. I discuss representations of solitude in modernist literature and conclude with a reading of Deleuze. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

 abstract     = {This series is intended to further the creation of the science of agent-based social systems, a field that is establishing itself as a transdisciplinary and cross-cultural science. The series will cover a broad spectrum of sciences, such as social systems theory, sociology, business administration, management information science, organization science, computational mathematical organization theory, economics, evolutionary economics, international political science, jurisprudence, policy science, socioinformation studies, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, complex adaptive systems theory, philosophy of science, and other related disciplines. The series will provide a systematic study of the various new cross-cultural arenas of the human sciences. Such an approach has been successfully tried several times in the history of the modern sciences of humanities and systems and has helped to create such important conceptual frameworks and theories as cybernetics, synergetics, general systems theory, cognitive science, and complex adaptive systems. We want to create a conceptual framework and design theory for socioeconomic systems of the twenty-first century in a cross-cultural and transdisciplinary context. For this purpose we plan to take an agent-based approach. Developed over the last decade, agent-based modeling is a new trend within the social sciences and is a child of the modern sciences of humanities and systems. In this series the term “agent- based” is used across a broad spectrum that includes not only the classical usage of the normative and rational agent but also an interpretive and subjective agent. We seek the antinomy of the macro and micro, subjective and rational, functional and structural, bottom-up and top-down, global and local, and structure and agency within the social sciences. Agent-based modeling includes both sides of these opposites. “Agent” is our grounding for modeling; simulation, theory, and real-world grounding are also required.},

 abstract     = {The issues of empirical calibration of parameter values and functional relationships describing the interactions between the various actors plays an important role in agent based modelling. Agent-based models range from purely theoretical exercises focussing on the patterns in the dynamics of interactions processes to modelling frameworks which are oriented closely at the replication of empirical cases. ABMs are classified in terms of their generality and their use of empirical data. In the literature the recommendation can be found to aim at maximizing both criteria by building so-called 'abductive models'. This is almost the direct opposite of Milton Friedman's famous and provocative methodological credo 'the more significant a theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions'. Most methodologists and philosophers of science have harshly criticised Friedman's essay as inconsistent, wrong and misleading. By presenting arguments for a pragmatic reinterpretation of Friedman's essay, we will show why most of the philosophical critique misses the point. We claim that good simulations have to rely on assumptions, which are adequate for the purpose in hand and those are not necessarily the descriptively accurate ones.},

This article is a gentle introduction to the subject; it starts with motivation and follows the historical development of the challenge of defining a semantics for logic programs with negation. It looks into positive programs over stratified programs to arbitrary programs, and then proceeds to extensions with two kinds of negation (named weak and strong negation), and disjunction in rule heads. The second part then considers the ASP paradigm itself, and describes the basic idea. It shows some programming techniques and briefly overviews Answer Set solvers. The third part is devoted to ASP in the context of the Semantic Web, presenting some formalisms and mentioning some applications in this area. The article concludes with issues of current and future ASP research.},

This project was initiated with a collection of handmade drawings that share the common characteristic of being similar but never identical. This resemblance with a biological population of individuals, led us to its usage with the Evolutionary Sound Synthesis methodology. From each drawing we retrieved sonic features that were represented by a subpatch into the Pd system implementation. As Pd allows the development of patch generating other patches, this system acts as if they are individuals artificially living inside a population, were they grow, reproduced and eventually dye. This paper describes the technical aspects of RePartitura implementation; the mapping of drawings into sonic features, the design and breeding of individuals and the final sonic result of all individuals coexisting within the population, thus leading to the self-organization of dynamically evolving soundscapes.},

Varying both of these factors produced significant results: sub- jects using the system that employed a pre-order description strategy asked for instructions to be repeated significantly less often than those who experienced the post-order strategy, while the subjects who heard references generated by the full reference strategy judged the robot's instructions to be significantly more understandable than did those who heard the output of the basic strategy.},

As relationships are increasingly formed by spatially dis- tributed partners, supporting social presence has become more important. It is proposed that due to it's inherent intimacy that haptic, specifically ther- mal, stimuli could provide greater levels of social presence. This project begins by analysing the existing literature; specifically discussing communication, the concept of social presence and awareness. A thermal device is designed and constructed to investigate the theory that thermal stimuli can help support re- lationships by increasing feelings of social presence. The findings indicate that there was a significant difference between participants that wore the thermal device and those that did not. The project ends with placing these findings with regards to the existing literature before discussing areas of further work},

AI was generally marked by a very ambitious, long-term vision requiring expensive systems, although the term was rarely envisioned as being as long as it proved to be, whereas HCI focused more on innovation and improvement of widely-used hardware within a short time-scale. These differences led to different priorities, methods, and assessment approaches. A consequence was competition for resources, with HCI flourishing in AI winters and moving more slowly when AI was in favor. The situation today is much more promising, in part because of platform convergence: AI can be exploited on widely-used systems.},

This interaction represents a source of enforcement problems and transaction costs in the context of governing transactions. Institutional analysis frameworks used in agricultural economics should consider the particular properties of transactions involving natural systems. For ordering nature-related transactions, we propose a heuristic framework based on two dimensions: 'modularity and decomposability of structures' and 'functional interdependence of processes'. It serves as a starting point for establishing a typology ranging from 'atomistic-isolated transactions' to 'complexinterconnected transactions'. The complex process of institutionalising such transactions is decomposed into conceptual categories by means of a 'transaction-interdependence cycle'.},

 abstract     = {Agency in interactive narrative is often narrowly understood as a user's freedom to either perform virtually embodied ac- tions or alter the mechanics of narration at will, followed by an implicit assumption of “the more agency the better.” This paper takes notice of a broader range of agency phenomena in interactive narrative and gaming that may be addressed by integrating accounts of agency from diverse fields such as so- ciology of science, digital media studies, philosophy, and cul- tural theory. The upshot is that narrative agency is contextu- ally situated, distributed between the player and system, and mediated through user interpretation of system behavior and system affordances for user actions. In our new and devel- oping model of agency play, multiple dimensions of agency can be tuned during story execution as a narratively situated mechanism to convey meaning. More importantly, we pro- pose that this model of variable dimensions of agency can be used as an expressive theoretical tool for interactive narrative design. Finally, we present our current interactive narrative work under development as a case study for how the agency play model can be deployed expressively},

In the Zocalo system, management of user actions has been performed on a reactionary basis by a process called mediation. In this paper, we describe an extension to this approach, proactive mediation, which calculates responses to user input in an anticipatory manner. A proactive mediation module accepts as input a plan describing the actions being performed by the user (generated by a plan recognition system) and identifies portions of that plan that jeopardize the causal structure of the overall narrative. Once these portions are identified, proactive mediation generates modifications to the narrative plan structure that avoid the unwanted interaction between user and story. This extension to the original mediation algorithm provides more responses to a user's actions and generates responses that are tailored to the user's activity.},

This chapter argues that the homeless garden provides a corner of order, a “still point of the turning world,” and thus a point of contact between uprooted individuals and the world in which they live: a re-enchantment of space. It claims that to understand this is to refuse the equal injustice, the equal projective reduction, of seeing only distress.},

 abstract     = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS “This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book.”},

First we define our basic Dynamic Logic of Agency (DLA). Differently from other logics of individual and coalitional capability such as Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) and Coalition Logic, in DLA cooperation modalities for expressing powers of agents and coalitions are not primitive, but are defined from more basic dynamic logic operators of action and (historic) necessity. We show that STIT logic can be reconstructed in DLA. We then extend DLA with epistemic operators, which allows us to distinguish capability and power. We finally characterize the conditions under which agents are aware of their capabilities and powers. TS - JSTOR},

 abstract     = {The role of story and narrative within games has been debated at length. By taking the approach that narrative can be understood with games, but only by incorporating the dynamics of game play and by accepting that existing models of narrative must be modified, this paper examines the place of narrative within role-playing games. Narrative can be defined as a description of a series of events. The description that narrative represents is experienced by the players, in an individual and personal manner. The implications of this for familiar concepts such as story and text are examined, and definitions proposed for them in the role-playing game context. Each can be best understood as unique to each participant in the game. The result shows that existing theories can be applied to the gaming context, but only with significant modification. The definitions proposed also allow for an initial consideration of how narrative is constructed in role-playing games.},

 abstract     = {The social and organisational aspects of agency have led to a good amount of theoretical work in terms of formal models and theories. However, the conception and engineering of proper organisational infrastructures embodying such models and theories are still an open issue. The introduction of normative concerns with requirements of openness and adaptation stresses this issue. The corresponding mechanisms for the current infrastructures appear to be not appropriate for managing distributed and open normative organisations. There is still the need of proper abstractions and tools to facilitate application agents taking part in the monitoring of the organisation on one hand, and in the adaptation and definition of the organisation in which they are situated on the other hand. In this paper we present and discuss ORA4MAS (Organisational Artifacts for Multi-Agent Systems), a proposed approach aiming at these issues. Based on the Agents and Artifacts meta-model ( A   A ), it introduces organisational artifacts as first class entities to instrument the organisation for supporting agents activities within it.},

The present study set out to explore the attitudes, experiences, and feelings of online gamers. The study entailed 71 interviews with online gamers (52 males, 19 females) from 11 different countries. Six main themes emerged from the analyses of the interview transcripts: (a) online gaming and integration into day-to-day lives; (b) online gaming, excessive play, and problems; (c) addiction; (d) psychosocial impact of online gaming; (e) online gaming, dissociation, and time loss; and (f) online gaming and the alleviation of negative feelings and mood states. These findings specifically showed how gamers used MMORPGs to alleviate negative feelings and provided detailed descriptions of personal problems that had arisen due to playing MMORPGs. The implica-tions of these findings are discussed in relation to previous qualitative and quantitative research in the area.},

However, most of the research on interruption in the area of human-computer interaction has focused on understanding and managing interruptions from external sources. Internal interruptions – user-initiated switches away from a task prior to its completion – are not well understood. In this paper we describe a qualitative study of self-interruption on the computer. Using a grounded theory approach, we identify seven categories of self-interruptions in computer-related activities. These categories are derived from direct observations of users, and describe the motivation, potential consequences, and benefits associated with each type of self-interruption observed. Our research extends the understanding of the self-interruption phenomenon, and informs the design of systems to support discretionary task interleaving on the computer.},

 abstract     = {Social tagging arose out of the need to organize found content that is worth revisiting. A significant side effect has been the use of social tagging sites as navigational signposts for interesting content. The collective behavior of users who tagged contents seems to offer a good basis for exploratory search interfaces, even for users who are not using social bookmarking sites. In this paper, we present the design of a tag-based exploratory system and detail an experiment in understanding its effectiveness. The tag-based search system allows users to utilize relevance feedback on tags to indicate their interest in various topics, enabling rapid exploration of the topic space. The experiment shows that the system seems to provide a kind of scaffold for users to learn new topics.},

 abstract     = {The commercial games industry is struggling to find a form of narrative for single-player story-based games that takes advantage of the medium. Current methods are limited to structured narrative or simulation, both of which have serious game design constraints. Drama Management represents a potential new model. This talk will cover the author's research into bringing interactive storytelling to single-player story games. Focusing on the design and production needs of current titles, different groups of penand- paper RPG Game Masters were studied, and their interactive narrative approach was algorithmically replicated for video game storytelling on a per-encounter level. To verify these results, an “Encounter Manager” pen-and-paper algorithm was tested in place of a human Game Master, achieving similar storytelling results and exposing new conclusions. Implementing these techniques in several video game projects has shown diverse payoffs, not just in narrative, replayability, and pacing but also in risk-reduction, art production, open world and linear level design, and new game genres. However, the uncertainty and risk of a new model of game production combined with the lack of a driving need in commercial games has so far proven a major hurdle for this approach. Looking forward, similarities with other procedural narrative efforts are explored, and future steps are proposed.},

State-of-the-art tools exist for both, but the domains have remained notoriously separate because different computational paradigms fit each domain best. This impedance mismatch hampers the development of new solutions because the desired functionality and scalability can only be achieved by repeated and ad hoc integration of different techniques. Rascal is a domain-specific language that takes away most of this boilerplate by integrating source code analysis and manipulation at the conceptual, syntactic, semantic and technical level. We give an overview of the language and assess its merits by implementing a complex refactoring.},

 abstract     = {In the recent years, several formal approaches to the specification of normative multi-agent systems (MASs) and artificial institutions have been proposed. The aim of this article is to advance the state of the art in this area by proposing an approach in which a normative MAS is conceived to be autonomous, in the sense that it is able to create, maintain and eventually change its own institutions by itself, without the intervention of an external designer in this process. In our approach the existence and the dynamics of an institution (norms, rules, institutional facts, etc.) are determined by the (individual and collective) acceptances of its members, and its dynamics depends on the dynamics of these acceptances. In order to meet this objective, we propose the logic [A][L] (Acceptance Logic) in which the acceptance of a proposition by the agents qua members of an institution is introduced. Such propositions are true w.r.t. an institutional context and correspond to facts that are instituted in an attitude-dependent way. The second part of the article is devoted to the logical characterization of some important notions in the theory of institutions. We provide a formalization of the concept of constitutive rule, expressed by a statement of the form X counts as Y in the context of institution x'. Then, we formalize the concepts of obligation and permission (so called regulative rules). In our approach, constitutive rules and regulative rules of a certain institution are attitude-dependent facts which are grounded on the acceptances of the members of the institution.},

 abstract     = {Stories have been engaging humans for thousands of years, but in interactive narrative environments, the narrative is perceived to diminish as the source of engagement. One reason for this apparent diminution, is that in interactive environments there has been difficulty in understanding the relationship between the design of the unfolding story, and the ability of a user within the story world to alter the course of events. As yet there are no standard or accepted evaluative methods to understand interaction at a granular level, and to understand how stories and narratives flow across the expanse of technologies and mixed realities that characterise the way people communicate, share knowledge and are entertained. This thesis presents a novel methodology called the Four-Factor Framework, that takes as its premise that there are four fundamental elements in interactive stories and narratives that can be observed. The Four-Factor Framework facilitates the evaluation of interaction and stories by mapping the dynamic connections between the four fundamental elements: agency, drama, narrative and engagement. A key innovation of this work is the observation and measurement of change in these four elements as a story develops through user interaction and story design. This perspective has not previously been demonstrated. The results of this study indicate that the Four-Factor Framework methodology does facilitate the observation and measurement of the fundamental elements. Furthermore, the data collected using the methodology suggests strong and novel associations between agency, drama, narrative and engagement.},

Examples include Google, Wikipedia, Threadless, and many others. To take advantage of the possibilities these new systems represent, it is necessary to go beyond just seeing them as a fuzzy collection of “cool” ideas. What is needed is a deeper understanding of how these systems work. This article offers a new framework to help provide that understanding. It identifies the underlying building blocks - to use a biological metaphor, the “genes” - at the heart of collective intelligence systems. These genes are defined by the answers to two pairs of key questions: - Who is performing the task? Why are they doing it? - What is being accomplished? How is it being done? The paper goes on to list the genes of collective intelligence - the possible answers to these key questions - and shows how combinations of genes comprise a ”genome” that characterizes each collective intelligence system. In addition, the paper describes the conditions under which each gene is useful and the possibilities for combining and re-combining these genes to harness crowds effectively. Using this framework, managers can systematically consider many possible combinations of genes as they seek to develop new collective intelligence systems.},

The articles forming this volume reflect a variety of important trends, developments, and applications covering a range of current topics relating to the theory and applications of argumentation. Our aims in this introduction are, firstly, to place these contributions in the context of the historical foundations of argumentation in AI and, subsequently, to discuss a number of themes that have emerged in recent years resulting in a significant broadening of the areas in which argumentation based methods are used. We begin by presenting a brief overview of the issues of interest within the classical study of argumentation: in particular, its relationship-in terms of both similarities and important differences-to traditional concepts of logical reasoning and mathematical proof. We continue by outlining how a number of foundational contributions provided the basis for the formulation of argumentation models and their promotion in AI related settings and then consider a number of new themes that have emerged in recent years, many of which provide the principal topics of the research presented in this volume. ©2007 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, story generators rely on a large repository of background knowledge containing information about the story plot and its characters. This information is detailed and usually hand crafted. In this paper we propose a data-driven approach for generating short children's stories that does not require extensive manual involvement. We create an end-to-end system that realizes the various components of the generation pipeline stochastically. Our system follows a generate-and-and-rank approach where the space of multiple candidate stories is pruned by considering whether they are plausible, interesting, and coherent.},

This can make it difficult to obtain an overview of the field both for contributing researchers and for outsiders who are interested in social simulation. The Journal for Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS) completing its tenth year provides a good opportunity to take stock of what happened over this time period. First, we use citation analysis to identify the most influential publications and to verify characteristics of social simulation such as its multidisciplinary nature. Then, we perform a co-citation analysis to visualize the intellectual structure of social simulation and its development. Overall, the analysis shows social simulation both in its early stage and during its first steps towards becoming a more differentiated discipline.},

 abstract     = {The Internet has become a place of refuge for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular, weblogs are a popular option for personal expression via the Internet. Perhaps this means of communication is well suited to bypassing deficits in social interaction and communication that characterize ASD. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionaries [10], we compared blogs of individuals with ASD to the writing of neurotypical (NT) bloggers. We found that rates of word usage were nearly identical in the two groups with one exception - there was more variation in the use of social words in ASD compared to NT blogs. This similarity in language between ASD and NT authors suggests that communication deficits routinely found in people with ASD may be due to the social context in which their communication skills are tested, and that the affordances of asynchronous computer-mediated communication may offer alternative means of testing and expression.

This is especially troublesome for projects that require specialization. Rather than using toolkits that are the most publicized but are designed for general projects, using this paper, one will be able to choose a toolkit that already exists and that may be built especially for one's particular domain and specialized needs. In this paper, we examine the entire continuum of agent based toolkits. We characterize each based on 5 important characteristics users consider when choosing a toolkit, and then we categorize the characteristics into user-friendly taxonomies that aid in rapid indexing and easy reference.},

Inherent to such communities is the collection and sharing of personal information, which in turn may raise concerns about privacy. In this study, we extend prior research on internet privacy to address questions about antecedents of privacy concerns in social computing communities, as well as the impact of privacy concerns in such communities. The results indicate that users' trust in other community members, and the community's information sharing norms have a negative impact on community-specific privacy concerns. We also find that community-specific privacy concerns not only lead users to adopt more restrictive information sharing settings, but also reduce the amount of information they share with the community. In addition, we find that information sharing is impacted by network centrality and the tenure of the user in the community. Implications of the study for research and practice are discussed.},

New understandings of fiction permitted Enlightenment-era Europeans to find an acceptable outlet for their fascination with otherworldly phenomena in the protected space of literature. In the mid-eighteenth century, “fantastic” and “realist” fiction were both understood as inhabiting an imaginative realm that was taken for ”real” while readers inhabited it. The imagination itself was seen as helping to constitute reality, a move that anticipated twentieth-century phenomenology and pragmatism. This chapter concludes that it was the Enlightenment that originally gave birth to the possibility for experiencing fiction as the site of a disenchanted enchantment, one which is ”real” only as long as the story lasts},

As with previous editions, a MIPS processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O. Along with its increased coverage of parallelism, this new edition offers new content on Flash memory and virtual machines as well as a new and important appendix written by industry experts covering the emergence and importance of the modern GPU (graphics processing unit), the highly parallel, highly multithreaded multiprocessor optimized for visual computing. A new exercise paradigm allows instructors to reconfigure the 600 exercises included in the book to easily generate new exercises and solutions of their own. A CD provides a toolkit of simulators and compilers along with tutorials for using them as well as additional problems and solutions, and references.},

The contributors are some of the most renowned scholars working on video games today including Henry Jenkins, Jesper Juul, Eric Zimmerman, and Mia Consalvo. While the first volume had a strong focus on early video games, this volume also addresses more contemporary issues such as convergence and MMORPGs. The volume concludes with an appendix of nearly 40 ideas and concepts from a variety of theories and disciplines that have been usefully and insightfully applied to the study of video games.},

We work with a corpus of implicit relations present in newspaper text and report results on a test set that is representative of the naturally occurring distribution of senses. We use several linguistically informed features, including polarity tags, Levin verb classes, length of verb phrases, modality, context, and lexical features. In addition, we revisit past approaches using lexical pairs from unannotated text as features, explain some of their shortcomings and propose modifications. Our best combination of features outperforms the baseline from data intensive approaches by 4 },

There are two types of ambiguity that need to be resolved during discourse processing. First, a word can be ambiguous between discourse or non-discourse usage. For example, once can be either a temporal discourse connective or a simply a word meaning “formerly”. Secondly, some connectives are ambiguous in terms of the relation they mark. For example since can serve as either a temporal or causal connective. We demonstrate that syntactic features improve performance in both disambiguation tasks. We report state-of-the-art results for identifying discourse vs. non-discourse usage and human-level performance on sense disambiguation.},

The discrete search uses the discrete transitions of the hybrid system and coarse-grained decompositions of the continuous state spaces or related projections to guide the motion planner during the search for witness trajectories. Experiments presented in this paper, using a hybrid system inspired by robot motion planning and with nonlinear dynamics associated with each of several thousand modes, provide an initial validation of HyDICE and demonstrate its promise as a hybrid-system testing method. Comparisons to related work show computational speedups of up to two orders of magnitude. ©Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

We base our approach on Latent Dirichlet Al- location and evaluate along two dimen- sions: (1) the precision of the ranked lists of attributes, and (2) the quality of the attribute assignments to WORDNET concepts. In all cases we find that the principled LDA-based approaches outper- form previously proposed heuristic meth- ods, greatly improving the specificity of attributes at each concept.},

Challenges for Game Designers: Non-Digital Exercises for Video Game Designers is filled with enjoyable, interesting, and challenging exercises to help you become a better video game designer, whether you are a professional or aspire to be. Each chapter covers a different topic important to game designers, and was taken from actual industry experience. After a brief overview of the topic, there are five challenges that each take less than two hours and allow you to apply the material, explore the topic, and expand your knowledge in that area. Each chapter also includes 10 `non-digital shorts' to further hone your skills. None of the challenges in the book require any programming or a computer, but many of the topics feature challenges that can be made into fully functioning games. The book is useful for professional designers, aspiring designers, and instructors who teach game design courses, and the challenges are great for both practice and homework assignments. The book can be worked through chapter by chapter, or you can skip around and do only the challenges that interest you. As with anything else, making great games takes practice and Challenges for Game Designers provides you with a collection of fun, thoughtprovoking, and of course, challenging activities that will help you hone vital skills and become the best game designer you can be.

Using contextual inquiry and lab-based user study, we explored the switchover in human-computer-paper interaction and determined what incites this interaction.

 abstract     = {Gor is one of the most successful role-play themes in the Virtual World of Second Life (SL). In this theme, player-characters act out a barbaric world of sexual slavery that is based on the novels of John Norman. Norman's narrative comes alive in privately owned 3D simulations (SIMs) that depict settlements in Roman, Viking, or tribal style. This paper gives insight into the construction of Gorean role-play, and positions it within the discourse on role-play in Virtual Worlds. The role-play was studied by undertaking an ethnographic participant-observation. Moreover, the rules of the city of Veroda (a pseudonym) are analysed in detail. The analysis shows that Veroda's rules aim at immersion in the role-play experience and are concerned with the power structure of the SIM, as well as with the personal power relationships of its members. In conclusion, Gorean SIM communities are closed or semi-closed social groups that act as real communities “living” in a particular shared online place. Whereas within gaming worlds the play occurs under the rules of game-design, Gorean role-play groups in Second Life construct their own social rules and play. In doing so, they create and maintain a vibrant community life.},

The object of the paper is to provide enhanced insights in the opportunities and barriers ICT holds within these negotiations. The paper draws on a qualitative interview study which explores the significance of ICT in the everyday lives of 23 disabled Norwegian youth, aged 15?20 years. The analysis of the data material is inspired by the principles in constructivist grounded theory. This paper illuminates how the widespread dissemination of ICT involves complex dependencies and mechanisms of exclusion and marginalization of disabled youth, as well as inclusion. The access to ICT, and provision of ICT assistive devices, do not necessarily provide usable and suitable ICT, and this leaves some disabled youth at a neglected dead end which excludes them from their peer group.},

 abstract     = {Often, video game designers must choose between creating a restrictive, linear experience and designing an open world with many different story lines that fail to form a tightly crafted narra- tive arc. A drama manager (DM) can provide a solution to this dilemma. A DM monitors an interactive experience, such as a computer game, and intervenes to shape the global experience so that it satisfies the authors expressive goals without decreasing a players interactive agency. Previous work with declarative op- timization-based drama management (DODM) has focused on simulated player studies in abstract game worlds. In this paper, we present the integration of DODM into a real-time adventure- style dungeon game called EMPath. We describe the game world as well as the modifications that had to be made to the DM as the result of integrating with a concrete, playable experience. These changes include the development of new story evaluation fea- tures, improving drama management move refiners and creating a new player model. We also describe the results of a play test comparing player experiences with the drama manager on and off. Introduction},

However, the use of model transformation languages may present challenges to those who are unfamiliar with a specific transformation language. This paper presents an approach called model transformation by demonstration (MTBD), which allows an end-user to demonstrate the exact transformation desired by actually editing a source model and demonstrating the changes that evolve to a target model. An inference engine built into the un- derlying modeling tool records all editing operations and infers a transformation pattern, which can be reused in other models. The paper motivates the need for the approach and discusses the technical contributions of MTBD. A case study with several sample inferred transformations serves as a concrete example of the benefits of MTBD. Keywords:},

This conception of agency is aimed at understanding the pleasures of engaging with narratively rich games, and helps to address the tension between player choice and authorial intent. We draw on what speech act theory says about how trust, meaning and communication are achieved in human conversation, applying these notions to interactive storytelling. This new perspective on agency provides us with a better analytical tool for understanding the relationship between interaction and narrative pleasure, and provides a useful metric for designers of story- rich games. eScholarship},

Our participants communicated ownership, demarcated boundaries and asserted their control over artifacts for the sake of quality by appropriating existing features of Wikipedia.

 abstract     = {The research in this thesis aims to enable robots to imitate humans. Learning by imitation is a fundamental part of human behaviour, since it allows humans to acquire motor skills simply by demonstration; seen from a robotic viewpoint you can easily “program” your fellow humans by showing them what to do. Would it not be great if the same mechanism could be used to program robots? A robot is programmed by specifying the torque of its motors. The torque can be regarded as the force or strength that is the result of muscles contracting or relaxing. Typical approaches to determine motor torques that will lead to a desired behaviour include setting them manually, i.e. on a trial-and-error basis, or specifying them by mathematical equations. Neither of these are intuitive to most humans, so most robot behaviours are programmed by engineers. However, if an engineer was to design a preprogrammed housekeeping robot, it would be very hard to program all the possible behaviours the robot could be expected to perform, even in such a limited domain. It is much more cost-efficient to make the robot learn what to do. This would allow the robot to adapt to its human owner, and not the other way around. Since humans easily learn new behaviours by imitating others, it would be ideal if humans could use the same technique to transfer motor knowledge to robots. I believe research in this area could be of great help to bridge the human-robot interaction gap that currently exists, so that you could have truly intelligent robots that could assist people in everyday life. To understand imitation learning, knowledge of psychology and neuroscience is required. The research in this thesis has taken an interdisciplinary approach, studying the desired mechanism on both a behavioural and neuroscientific level. I have focused on imitation in a musical setting. The system can both see and hear, and seeks to imitate the perceived behaviour. The application has been to create an intelligent virtual drummer, that imitates both the physical playing style (i.e. the movement of the arms) as well as the musical playing style (i.e. the groove) of the teacher. The virtual drummer will then both look and sound like a human drummer. The research in this thesis presents a multi-modal architecture for imitation of human movements. I have been working on simulated robots due to limits of time and money, however the principles of my research have been developed in a platformindependent way, so it should be applicable to real robots as well.},

Participants created an avatar for one of three contrasting settings: blogging, dating or gaming. For the most part, avatars in blogging were created to accurately reflect their owners' physical appearance, lifestyle and preferences. By contrast, participants in the dating and gaming treatments accentuated certain aspects of their avatar to reflect the tone and perceived expectations of the context. For instance, avatars in dating were made to look more attractive while avatars in gaming were made to look more intellectual. Yet, predominantly, these emphasized avatar attributes drew on participants' self-image, and thus avatars were perceived by their owners as highly similar to themselves. The implications of these results are discussed against current frameworks of online identity and behavior. Most importantly, we use our results to extract design recommendations for improving avatar-driven applications. ©2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We focus, in particular, on observed gaming practices that emphasized the individual gamer within a gaming group as well as practices that emphasized the gaming group as a whole. We relate each of these practices, where possible, to specific elements of the game design, including game mechanics, interaction design, and special effects design. We argue that the classic distinction between competitive and cooperative modes of gameplay does not transfer to fully account for the interpersonal dynamics of collocated gaming groups.},

For decades, the main principle of interacting with files, emails, and bookmarks has remained unchanged: hierarchical directory trees with standard (Windows Explorer style) browsers. Users often have problems both in classifying new items and maintaining a classification hierarchy as such. With files, emails, and bookmarks, users often end up maintaining three parallel classi- fication hierarchies, one in each tool. Over the past thirty years, a number of alternative personal information management (PIM) tools have emerged, but the typical user is still faced with hierarchical directory structures. This position paper addresses some of the reasons why modern PIM tools are not widespread and proposes a set of eight require- ments for future PIM tools.},

 abstract     = {Human interaction with technical artifacts is often mediated by treating them as if they are alive. We exclaim “my car doesn't want to start,” or “my computer loves to crash.” Of increasing cultural importance are software systems designed explicitly to perform tasks and/or exhibit complex behaviors usually deemed as intentional human phenomena, including creating, improvising, and learning. Compared to the instrumental programs (e.g., Adobe Photoshop ), these intentional systems (e.g., George Lewis' musical system Voyager ) seem to produce output that is ”about” certain things in the world rather than the mere execution of algorithmic rules. This dissertation investigates such phenomena with two central research questions: (1) How is system intentionality formed? and (2) What are the design implications for building systems that utilize such intentionality as an expressive resource. In the discourse of artificial intelligence (AI) practice, system intentionality is typically seen as a technical and ontological property of a computer program, emerging from its underlying algorithms and knowledge engineering. Distilling from the areas of hermeneutics, actor-network theory, cognitive semantics theory, and philosophy of mind, this dissertation proposes a humanistic and interpretive framework called the AI hermeneutic network . It accentuates that system intentionality is narrated and interpreted by its human creators and users in their socio-cultural settings. Special attention is paid to system authors' discursive strategies, a constitutive component of AI, embedded in their source code and technical literature. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a close analytical reading of a full-scale AI system, Copycat . The theoretical discovery leads to new design strategies, namely scale of intentionality and agency play . They provide insights for using system intentionality and agency as expressive resources that can be used to convey meanings and express ideas. The fruits of these insights are illustrated by a stream of consciousness literature inspired interactive narrative project Memory, Reverie Machine, co-developed using Harrell's GRIOT system. It portrays a protagonist whose intentionality and agency vary dynamically in service of narrative needs.},
