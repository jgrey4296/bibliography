 abstract     = {This paper seeks to offer an alternative approach to the study of prejudice than that based upon the notion of categorization which is currently influential in cognitive social psychology. It is argued that the categorization approach assumes the inevitability of prejudice and ignores the issue of tolerance. The assumptions of the categorization approach are criticized, and it is suggested that, by focusing on categorization as a cognitive process, it has overlooked an opposing process-that of particularization. The result has been a rather mechanical and bureaucratic model of cognition. A less mechanical view is possible if the relations between the two processes of categorization and particularization are considered from a rhetorical perspective, which examines the argumentative nature of thought. For theoretical and empirical reasons, this perspective does not equate prejudiced thinking with rigid categorization; instead a rhetorical approach permits a distinction between prejudice and tolerance on the basis of content, rather than form, and thereby avoids assuming the inevitability of prejudice.},

Their addressees may not know the information, may be unwilling to give it, or may not remember it. In three experiments we show that speakers estimate the greatest potential obstacle to compliance and try to overcome it through their choice of indirect, or conditional, request. If speakers thought addressees might not remember the time of a concert, they could make their request conditional on the addressees' remembering the time and choose Do you remember what time the concert begins tonight?, meaning “Do you remember what time the concert begins, and if you do, please tell me.” In selecting their request, speakers in most situations try to pinpoint the obstacle as specifically as they can. ?? 1985.},
