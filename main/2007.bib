We predicted World of Warcraft players would create their main character more similar to their ideal self than the players themselves were. Our results support this idea; a sample of players rated their character as having more favorable attributes that were more favorable than their own self-rated attributes. This trend was stronger among those with lower psychological well-being, who rated themselves comparatively lower than they rated their character. Our results suggest that the game world allows players the freedom to create successful virtual selves regardless of the constraints of their actual situation.},

 abstract     = {In this paper we address the problem of defining social roles in multi-agent systems. Social roles provide the basic structure of social institutions and organizations. We start from the properties attributed to roles both in the multi-agent systems and the Object Oriented community, and we use them in an ontological analysis of the notion of social role. We identify three main properties of social roles. First, they are definitionally dependent on the institution they belong to, i.e. the definition of a role is given inside the definition of the institution. Second, they attribute powers to the agents playing them, like creating commitments for the institutions and the other roles. Third, they allow roles to play roles, in the same way as agents do. Using Input/Output logics, we propose a formalization of roles in multi-agent systems satisfying the three properties we identified.In this paper we address the problem of defining social roles in multi-agent systems.

 abstract     = {In Unit Operations, Ian Bogost argues that similar principles underlie both literary theory and computation, proposing a literary-technical theory that can be used to analyze particular videogames. Moreover, this approach can be applied beyond videogames: Bogost suggests that any medium-from videogames to poetry, literature, cinema, or art-can be read as a configurative system of discrete, interlocking units of meaning, and he illustrates this method of analysis with examples from all these fields. The marriage of literary theory and information technology, he argues, will help humanists take technology more seriously and hep technologists better understand software and videogames as cultural artifacts. This approach is especially useful for the comparative analysis of digital and nondigital artifacts and allows scholars from other fields who are interested in studying videogames to avoid the esoteric isolation of {\textquotedblleft}game studies.{\textquotedblright} Pong, Half-Life, and Star Wars Galaxies. Bogost draws on object technology and complex adaptive systems theory for his method of unit analysis, underscoring the configurative aspects of a wide variety of human processes. His extended analysis of freedom in large virtual spaces examines Grand Theft Auto 3, The Legend of Zelda, Flaubert's Madame Bovary, and Joyce's Ulysses. In Unit Operations, Bogost not only offers a new methodology for videogame criticism but argues for the possibility of real collaboration between the humanities and information technology.},

Jason is easily customisable and is suitable for the implementation of reactive planning systems according to the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture. Programming Multi-Agent Systems in AgentSpeak using Jason provides a brief introduction to multi-agent systems and the BDI agent architecture on which AgentSpeak is based. The authors explain Jason's AgentSpeak variant and provide a comprehensive, practical guide to using Jason to program multi-agent systems. Some of the examples include diagrams generated using an agent-oriented software engineering methodology particularly suited for implementation using BDI-based programming languages. The authors also give guidance on good programming style with AgentSpeak Programming Multi-Agent Systems in AgentSpeak using Jason. Describes and explains in detail the AgentSpeak extension interpreted by Jason and shows how to create multi-agent systems using the Jason platform. Reinforces learning with examples, problems, and illustrations. Includes two case studies which demonstrate the use of Jason in practice},

We focus on linguistic and inferential aspects of the human-robot communication process. The result is a novel approach using a principled semantic theory combined with techniques from automated deduction applied to a mobile robot platform. Due to the abstract level of the dialogue system, it is easily portable to other environments or applications},

Here, we illustrate how this can be achieved by reviewing recent work in two related areas: eyewitness testimony and fingerprint analysis. We articulate problems in these areas with reference to specific legal cases and demonstrate how recent findings can be used to address them. We also discuss how researchers can translate their conclusions into language and ideas that can influence and improve the legal system. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These studies are important because they can investigate the neural correlates of processes that are difficult to study using laboratory stimuli, including: (i) complex constructive processes, (ii) recollective qualities of emotion and vividness, and (iii) remote memory retrieval. Constructing autobiographical memories involves search, monitoring and self-referential processes that are associated with activity in separable prefrontal regions. The contributions of emotion and vividness have been linked to the amygdala and visual cortex respectively. Finally, there is evidence that recent and remote autobiographical memories might activate the hippocampus equally, which has implications for memory-consolidation theories. The rapid development of innovative methods for eliciting personal memories in the scanner provides the opportunity to delve into the functional neuroanatomy of our personal past.},

Complex events are composed of interrelated events, and they can be defined at any level of spatio-temporal abstraction (equal to or above the lowest level of abstraction given by the model). Minimal types of complex events define sets, which are equated with particular emergent behaviours and can be detected in simulation. Since complex events are derived from the agent-based model itself, they provide significant benefits when compared with traditional state-aggregationmethods. First, they provide a method of specifying emergent behaviour, so that such behaviour can be monitored. Second, they provide a mechanism that retains the underlying structure of that behaviour. This latter property supports analysis of the mechanisms at lower levels that give rise to emergent behaviours, and identification of patterns between levels. In other words, multi-agent simulations become less 'opaque'[1].},

Designers are faced with two concurrent, difficult tasks: firstly specifying the relationships (over time) of agents' actions and their effects, and secondly combining this model with another that captures the agents' permissions and obligations. In this paper we present our model and operational semantics for specifying individual and collective institutions and outline a declarative action language for describing them. We demonstrate, by way of an example, how this may be used to enable the analysis of institutional specifications either for simply visualising possible outcomes or for checking for absence or presence of certain (un)desirable correctness properties.},

Thus, when a person makes evaluative judgments or engages in a task, positive affect can enhance evaluations and empower potential responses. Rather than affect itself, the information conveyed by affect is crucial. Tests of the hypothesis find that affective influences can be made to disappear by changing the source to which the affect is attributed. In tasks, positive affect validates and negative affect invalidates accessible cognitions, leading to relational processing and item-specific processing, respectively. Positive affect is found to promote, and negative affect to inhibit, many textbook phenomena from cognitive psychology.},

This study explored the social interactions that occur both within and outside of MMORPGs. The sample consisted of 912 self-selected MMORPG players from 45 countries. MMORPGs were found to be highly socially interactive environments providing the opportunity to create strong friendships and emotional relationships. The study demonstrated that the social interactions in online gaming form a considerable element in the enjoyment of playing. The study showed MMORPGs can be extremely social games, with high percentages of gamers making life-long friends and partners. It was concluded that virtual gaming may allow players to express themselves in ways they may not feel comfortable doing in real life because of their appearance, gender, sexuality, and/or age. MMORPGs also offer a place where teamwork, encouragement, and fun can be experienced.},

Together with these intuitions the agents, called Jivas \$the most developed species of the ecosystem, devise actions through evolutionary computation. The game allows also the observation of all interactions among the various beings inhabiting Vidya. Interactions happen in a quasi-autonomous manner which grants the game with an interesting dynamics. The evolved Jiva's intelligence, which build-up during the game, can be reused in other game scenarios. This work might help on further understanding of some emergent autonomous behaviors and parameterization of intelligent agents that live in closely coupled ecosystems.},

Specifically, this analysis presents (a) an overview of the two primary elements in MMORPGs game design: character design and narrative environment, (b) a discussion of intrinsic motivation in character role-playing, (c) a discussion of intrinsic motivational supports and cognitive support of the narrative structure of small quests, and (d) a discussion of how the narrative structure of MMORPGs might foster learning in various types of knowledge.},

 abstract     = {Interactive narratives have been used in a variety of applications, including video games, educational games, and training simulations. Maintaining engagement within such environments is an important problem, because it affects entertainment, motivation, and presence. Performance arts theorists have discussed and formalized many techniques that increase engagement and enhance dramatic content of art productions. While constructing a narrative manually, using these techniques, is acceptable for linear media, using this approach for interactive environments results in inflexible experiences due to the unpredictability of users' actions. Few researchers attempted to develop adaptive interactive narrative experiences. However, developing a quality interactive experience is largely an art process, and many of these adaptive techniques do not encode artistic principles. This paper presents a new interactive narrative architecture designed using a set of dramatic techniques that have been formulated based on several years of training in film and theatre.},

Such a model of institutional reality makes us able also to define an objective and external semantics of a commitment-based Agent Communication Language (ACL). In particular we propose to regard an ACL as a set of conventions to act on a frag- ment of institutional reality, defined in the context of an artificial institution. Another contribution of the work presented in this paper is an operational definition of norms, a crucial component of artificial institutions. In fact in open systems interacting agents might not conform to the specifications. We regard norms as event-driven rules that when are fired by events happening in the system create or cancel a set of commit- ments. An interesting aspect of our proposal is that both the definition of the ACL and the definition of norms are based on the same notion of commitment. There- fore an agent capable of reasoning on commitments can reason on the semantics of communicative acts and on the system of norms.},

Even though play predates culture and games have long been pervasive in our civilization, the advent of videogames has pushed even further the role of games as communicational and cultural products. This situation demands a set of rhetori- cal tools that take into account the particularities of games and how they are played. The main objective of this dissertation is to provide a foundation upon which building play rhetoric, one that is complete enough to take into account the core elements that contrib- ute to the player's construction of meaning while engaged in play. In order to achieve this, it is first needed to question our current ontologies of play and game and propose an alter- native one that shifts the current systemic bias towards an approach that also takes into account player performance. Since ultimately the goal of this dissertation is to contribute to the nascent field of play rhetoric, it complements its theoretical tools with multiple examples of rhetorical analysis of games, videogames, toys and play activities.},

Neuroimaging studies bear on this issue by pointing to both language-based and visuospatial systems being engaged during logical reasoning, and by raising additional issues not anticipated by these cognitive theories. Here, the literature on the neural basis of deductive reasoning from the past decade is reviewed. Although these results might seem chaotic and inconsistent, we identify several interesting patterns and articulate their implications for cognitive theories of reasoning. Cognitive neuroscience data point away from a unitary system for logical reasoning and towards a fractionated system dynamically reconfigured in response to specific task and environmental cues.},

However, adoption of this software paradigm remains elusive in software engineering practice. We claim that part of the adoption problem lies with the fact that mentalistic and social concepts underlying agents are subjective and complex for the average practitioner. Specifically, although there are many efforts related to the topic coming from philosophy, cognitive sciences and computer science, a uniform and well-founded semantic view on these concepts is currently lacking. This work extends an existing upper-level ontology and offers it as a foundation for evaluating and designing agent-oriented modeling languages. In particular, the paper focuses on the concept of goal, aiming at disambiguating its definition, discussing its different manifestations, and clarifying its relation to other important agent-related concepts. For that, we examine how goals are conceived and used according to some relevant literature on agent-orientation. In addition, related work on akin fields, especially philosophy and AI are used as a basis for the proposed ontological extensions.},

We argue that allowing self-interested agents to enable social reputation as a mechanism for flexible self-regulation during runtime can improve the robustness and 'social order' of multiagent systems to cope with various perturbations that arise when simulating open markets (e.g. dynamic modifications of task profiles, scaling of agent populations, agent drop-outs, deviant behaviour). Referring to the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu, we provide a multi-level concept of reputation that consists of three different types (image, social esteem, and prestige) and considers reputation as a kind of 'symbolic capital'. Reputation is regarded to be objectified as an observable property and to be incorporated into the agents' mental structures through social practices of communication on different aggregation levels of sociality. We present and analyse selected results of our social simulations and discuss the importance of reputation with regard to the robustness of multiagent simulations of electronic markets. Keyw},

To acquire deference, one must exhibit the appropriate demeanor towards others, and one must be equipped with the cultural capital that fits the institutional context. Once acquired, deference is a kind of credit that can be deployed as the symbolic power to frame (define) actions, situations, and events in ways that induce compliance and shape the social order. I also consider how these dynamics are gendered in particular contexts. Data from a two-year ethnographic study of {\textquotedblleft}Costen Elementary School{\textquotedblright} brings the emergent theory to life. The theory helps explain interactions at the school and the efforts of administrators who tried to change the institutional order from autonomy to accountability.

This paper shines a spotlight on this scholarship, and offers new ways to think about the dizzying array of simulation we encounter in our organizational, institutional, and everyday lives. I define simulation as an empirical social process and show how they vary in consequence by their experiential modality, their referential frame, and their perceived realism. I then document three conceptual trends in the literature: (i) treating simulation as an organizational technique for risk management; (ii) a focus on virtual reality, video games, and moral ambiguity; and (iii) studies of the impact of computer simulation on scientific knowledge production and the reorganization of some technical fields, such as weapons research, artificial intelligence, and meteorology. Organizational uncertainty tends to coalesce around disputes about the appropriate qualities and functions of a given simulation technique or technology. I conclude the paper by identifying how the sociology of simulation can connect with more established areas of contemporary research within organizations, work and occupations, and institutional sociology.},

The authors validate a subset of these parameters by modeling two mobile phone tasks using two different phones and comparing model predictions to a sample of younger (N = 20; M-sub(age) = 20) and older (N = 20; M-sub(age) = 69) adults. Older adult models fit keystroke-level performance at the aggregate grain of analysis extremely well (R = 0.99) and produced equivalent fits to previously validated younger adult models. Critical path analyses highlighted points of poor design as a function of cognitive workload, hardware/software design, and user characteristics. The findings demonstrate that estimated older adult information processing parameters are valid for modeling purposes, can help designers understand age-related performance using existing interfaces, and may support the development of age-sensitive technologies.},

Prototyping and user evaluation can be enormously expensive and failure rates are high. Moreover, prototype user evaluations are often far from real with respect to user representatives, tasks, and measures. But to get real in HCI prototyping and evaluations risks placing even greater (more unrealistic) demands upon the HCI researcher. Do very real costs and constraints force HCI prototyping to the margins? Can we change acceptable HCI prototyping methods, helping HCI prototyping {\textquotedblleft}get real,{\textquotedblright} in both its conduct and in the implications of its results.},

This essay argues that the No Child Left Behind Act is an example of color-blindness {\textquotedblleft}par excellence.{\textquotedblright} NCLB's hidden referent of whiteness makes a casual pass at racial explanation that sidesteps race as a causal explanation for educational disparities. In this sense, NCLB is an {\textquotedblright}act of whiteness{\textquotedblright} and perpetuates the innocence of whiteness as a system of privilege. It is a form of whiteness as policy. Its white common sense deems racial disparities as unfortunate outcomes of group competition, uneven social development, or worse, as stubborn cultural explanations of the inferiority of people of color. The essay argues for a color-conscious perspective that problematizes the otherwise race-neutral discourse of NCLB. It ends with a discussion of the future of whiteness by engaging the debate between the abolition and rearticulation of whiteness. (Contains 3 notes.)},

 abstract     = {As the complexity of modern games increases, there has been a movement away from traditional artificial intelligence (AI) technologi es as developers search for AI that is more scalable, flexible and provides diverse behaviour in non-player characters (NPCs). Recent innovations in the field of AI Planning have seen the first Goal Oriented Action Planner (GOAP) developed for a commercial game. GOAP has been hailed as the next step in evolving AI in games and can offer several adv antages over traditional AI techniques. This dissertation investigated, analysed and compared a traditional AI technique, finite state machines, with Goal Oriented Action Planning when applied in games to discover whether GOAP is indeed an improvement over FSMs and what the relative merits of each system are. As part of the dissertation, a GOAP and FSM system was developed and placed in a game scenario where experiments were carried out between the two. Comparisons were made on three levels, the first was based on the resu lts of the games i.e. how the systems performed against one another in the Domination, Ca pture the Flag, Deathmatch and Last Man Standing game modes. The second comparison examined the two systems from a technical perspective and investigated how each system performed from a memory management, CPU usage and efficiency standpoint. The final comparison considers the merits of the two systems with respect to ease of mana gement, flexibility and re-usability. The results of the experiments clearly high lighted that GOAP is a superior AI system for many reasons however there are certain drawbacks associated with it which may require some consideration before choosing GOAP as a primary AI technique for a commercial game title. No other previous piece of work has ta ken a GOAP system and compared it with another AI technique so the findings of this dissertation add to the limite d pool of knowledge associated with AI planning in games.},

 abstract     = {Does face recognition involve face-specific cognitive and neural processes ('domain specificity') or do faces only seem special because people have had more experience of individuating them than they have of individuating members of other homogeneous object categories ('the expertise hypothesis')? Here, we summarize new data that test these hypotheses by assessing whether classic face-selective effects - holistic processing, recognition impairments in prosopagnosia and fusiform face area activation - remain face selective in comparison with objects of expertise. We argue that evidence strongly supports domain specificity rather than the expertise hypothesis. We conclude that the crucial social function of face recognition does not reflect merely a general practice phenomenon and that it might be supported by evolved mechanisms (visual or nonvisual) and/or a sensitive period in infancy. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article we present a novel framework for construct- ing semantic spaces that takes syntactic relations into account.We introduce a formalization for this class of models, which allows linguistic knowledge to guide the construction process. We evaluate our framework on a range of tasks relevant for cognitive science and natural language processing: semantic priming, synonymy detection, and word sense disambiguation. In all cases, our framework obtains results that are comparable or superior to the state of the art.},

Although relevant research exists across several disciplines including education and cognitive science, disciplinary differences have made this material inaccessible to many computing educators. Furthermore, computer science instructors have not had access to a comprehensive survey of research in this area. This paper collects and classifies this literature, identifies important work and mediates it to computing educators and professional bodies. We identify research that gives well-supported advice to computing academics teaching introductory programming. Limitations and areas of incomplete coverage of existing research efforts are also identified. The analysis applies publication and research quality metrics developed by a previous ITiCSE working group [74]. },

The discrete search uses the discrete transitions of the hybrid system and coarse-grained decompositions of the continuous state spaces or related projections to guide the motion planner during the search for witness trajectories. Experiments presented in this paper, using a hybrid system inspired by robot motion planning and with nonlinear dynamics associated with each of several thousand modes, provide an initial validation of HyDICE and demonstrate its promise as a hybrid-system testing method. Comparisons to related work show computational speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.},

This new orientation proposed that formal organizational structure reflected not only technical demands and resource dependencies, but was also shaped by institutional forces, including rational myths, knowledge legitimated through the educational system and by the professions, public opinion, and the law. The core idea that organizations are deeply embedded in social and political environments suggested that organizational practices and structures are often either reflections of or responses to rules, beliefs, and conventions built into the wider environment.},

The probability of a conclusion is calculated using a standard variant of Defeasible Logic, in combination with standard probability calculus. It is a new element of the present approach that the exchange of arguments is analysed with game theoretical tools, yielding a prescriptive and to some extent even predictive account of the actual course of play. A brief comparison with existing argument-based dialogue approaches confirms that such a prescriptive account of the actual argumentation has been almost lacking in the approaches proposed so far.},

Autonomous systems, including those that learn, may be faced with unan-ticipated situations that cause decreased performance, or in the worst-case, catastrophic failures from which the system cannot recover. In this paper, we describe a construct called the metacognitive loop (MCL) that allows AI systems to monitor their own behavior, generate expectations about their own progress and performance, and verify that they are met. When expectations are violated, the metacognitive loop attempts to reason in a domain-general way about why expectations were not met and how to recover. The basis for reasoning is a set of ontologies that encode abstract diagnosic and prescriptive processes for coping with failures.},

However, one of the issues is the regulation of the participating agents and their behaviour. A substantial body of work exists that investigates agent societies and agent organizations, including work on electronic institutions, such as Islander and Ameli. However, although such work provides concrete tools for specifying and enacting institutions, there is a lack of clear documented guidance to designers who are using these tools. In this paper we describe a methodology for developing an institutional structure for multi agent systems. This methodology captures the knowledge and experience within the Islander group, and integrates it with the Prometheus methodology. 1},

 abstract     = {Healthcare needs of women with disabilities are often neglected, even for women who are well connected to the community and to the healthcare system. So-called {\textquotedblleft}hard-to-reach{\textquotedblright} women, whose degree of disability impedes use of community resources, have even greater difficulty obtaining health care. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the perceptions of women with mobility and sensory limitations about several healthcare issues that may affect them: barriers to obtaining care, sources of information about health issues, ways to improve access to care, and ways to help hard-to-reach women overcome barriers to health care and health information. Researchers conducted six focus groups, comprising 43 women with limitations of mobility, hearing, or vision. To validate the women's input, researchers conducted two additional focus groups: the first comprised female physicians with special interest in the health care of women with disabilities, and the second included professional administrative staff of agencies that provide services for people with disabilities. In several cases, members of the physician and agency focus groups were themselves women with disabilities. In addition, 16 women with disabilities participated in an online survey; their responses were used to validate the findings of the face-to-face focus groups. Transcribed data were content analyzed and 10 themes identified. Seven of those themes are discussed in this article: communication barriers; lack of knowledge and awareness among healthcare providers; access issues; working the system; system issues; outreach to healthcare providers; and reaching hard-to-reach women. The findings of this study can provide direction to development of more effective outreach to hard-to-reach women with disabilities, resulting in better integration of healthcare services for this population.},

It examines Searle's work in relation to current issues of central significance, including internalism versus externalism about mental and linguistic content, truth-conditional versus non-truth-conditional conceptions of content, the relative priorities of thought and language in the explanation of intentionality, the status of the distinction between force and sense in the theory of meaning, the issue of meaning scepticism in relation to rule-following, and the proper characterization of 'what is said' in relation to the semantics/pragmatics distinction. Written by a distinguished team of contemporary philosophers, and prefaced by an illuminating essay by Searle, the volume aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of Searle's work in philosophy of language, and to suggest innovative approaches to fundamental questions in that area.},

 abstract     = {Research on agent communication languages has typically taken the speech acts paradigm as its starting point. Despite their manifest attractions, speech-act models of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for communication in artificial agent systems. In particular, it has proved to be extremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speech-act based agent communication languages. In part, the problem is that speech-act semantics typically make reference to the {\textquotedblleft}mental states{\textquotedblright} of agents (their beliefs, desires, and intentions), and there is in general no way to attribute such attitudes to arbitrary computational agents. In addition, agent programming languages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract, stand-alone versions, neglecting aspects such as communication primitives. With respect to communication, implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather ad hoc. This paper addresses both of these problems, by giving semantics to speech-act based messages received by an AgentSpeak agent. AgentSpeak is a logic-based agent programming language which incorporates the main features of the PRS model of reactive planning systems. The paper builds upon a structural operational semantics to AgentSpeak that we developed in previous work. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: an extension of our earlier work on the theoretical foundations of AgentSpeak interpreters; a computationally grounded semantics for (the core) performatives used in speech-act based agent communication languages; and a well-defined extension of AgentSpeak that supports agent communication.},

We show that OMeta's general-purpose pattern matching provides a natural and convenient way for programmers to implement tokenizers, parsers, visitors, and tree transformers, all of which can be extended in interesting ways using familiar object-oriented mechanisms. This makes Meta particularly well-suited as a medium for experimenting with new designs for programming languages and extensions to existing languages.},

 abstract     = {Cooperation and competition are important subjects in social and economical studies. Similar dynamics exists in large-scale online communities. In this paper, we present a quantitative study on the cooperation and competi- tion dynamics of an online gaming community. During a period of four months, we collected a total of over one million data points in an open game room with an online gaming site (www.ourgame.com.cn) for a popular card game {\textquotedblleft}up- grade{\textquotedblright}. The {\textquotedblright}upgrade{\textquotedblright} game room provided us an excellent environment to ob- serve how cooperative and competitive relationships are formed in an online community. Through the statistical analysis, we obtain the probability for play- ers with different score tags forming cooperative and competitive relationships with each other. Our analysis shows that all players exhibit preferential bias in their partner selection process, but shows little bias in their selection of com- petitors. Further, the cooperation bias is the strongest in both the low score and high score ends of the player population. We also discuss the effect of such preferential bias on the population distributions in the game community. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale quantitative study on the cooperation dy- namics in online gaming community. The online game community environment offers us a great proxy to study the same dynamics that is difficult to investigate in the real world social environment. The large, statistically significant amount of data enables us to develop and test many hypotheses.},
