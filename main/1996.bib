Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features. Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references. Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.},

[14] With the advent of the computer comes the potential to negotiate through many such models and variables within models as a means of generating multiple narratives quickly and semi-autonomously. The computational narrative model presented in this paper offers one approach to narrative generation, that of splitting the task into three functional areas: 1) defining an abstract narrative structure; 2) defining a collection and organization of story pieces with some representation of their meaning; and 3) a navigational strategy or reasoning through that collection of story pieces. Agent Stories is a story design and presentation environment for non-linear, multiple-point-ofview cinematic stories. It is designed to be placed in the hands of the non-linear story writer to use as a tool to promote structuring and re-writing of non-linear narratives before and as they are realized in audio and video.},

 abstract     = {This chapter addresses the question that most beginning qualitative researchers ask: 'How can I gather good data and then what should I do with them?' Starting out on a qualitative research project is an exciting challenge but can be a daunting venture. You can learn to do good qualitative research. Sometimes students and professional social scientists alike believe that an insightful qualitative study only results from the researcher's extraordinary talents. They are wrong. Good qualitative research results fr om hard work and systematic approaches. That means gathering enough data, synthesizing t hem and making analytic sense of them. Grounded theory methods provide a set of strategies fo r conducting rigorous qualitative research. These methods make the strategies of gifted qualitative researchers explicit and available to any diligent novice. Using grounded theory methods expedites your research, enables you to develop a cogent analysis and stimulates your excitement about and enjoyment of doing research. This chapter will help plan your data collection and give you strategies fo r handling your data analysis. In the fo llowing pages, I introduce the grounded theory method and show how a novice can apply its basic procedures. Throughout the discussion, I illustrate points by drawing upon my recent social psychological study of experiencing chronic illness. To begin, I provide a short discussion of the logic of grounded theory to explain its basic premises and strategies and to locate it within qualitative research more generally. Next, I discuss data collection objectives and strategies to show how to generate useful data. Then I move on to coding qualitative data and describe how creating categories early in the research shapes subsequent data collection. A discussion of memo-writing fo llows because it is the crucial intermediate step between data collection and writing drafts of papers. Finally, I compare the procedures of the grounded theory approach with traditional logico-deductive research design to clarify their differences. The logic of grounded theory Defining grounded theory What are grounded theory methods? They are a logically consistent set of data collection and analytic procedures aimed to develop theory. Grounded theory methods consist of a set of inductive strategies for},

 abstract     = {schools of thought: historical institutionalism, rational choice institutionalism, and sociological institutionalism.1 All of these approaches developed in reaction to the behavioral perspectives that were influential during the 1960s and 1970s and all seek to elucidate the role that institutions play in the determination of so- cial and political outcomes. However, they paint quite different pictures of the political world. In the sections that follow, we provide a brief account of the genesis of each school and characterize what is distinctive about its approach to social and politi- cal problems. We then compare their analytical strengths and weaknesses, focus- ing on the stance that each adopts toward two issues fundamental to any institu- tional analysis, namely, how to construe the relationship between institutions and behavior and how to explain the process whereby institutions originate or change.},

The interaction of masochistic and sadistic forces of dominance and submission along with their frequent referents, terror and trauma, is a powerful leitmotif of current society. In this article, masochism and psychopathic sadism are viewed as differing posttraumatic adaptations that rely upon defensive dissociation. The masochist has dissociated rage, aggression, and the perpetrator self-state while the psychopathic sadist has dissociated vulnerability, attachment, dependency, and the victim self-state. Specific reference is made to the influence of gender and group dynamics on individual dissociative processes, and the role of the bystander. Several conclusions are reached including that individuals live in a time that predisposes to violence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Frequently, the states of affairs are of a normative kind, in the sense that they pertain to rights and obligations, as for instance when a Head of Department signs a purchase agreement and thereby creates an obligation on his employer to pay for goods received. We use the term institutionalised power to stand for the notion of power we here seek to explicate. Following a lead from jurisprudential discussions of legal power, we distinguish institutionalised power from permission and practical possibility. We define a conditional connective intended to capture the consequence relation implicit in statements of the form: according to the constraints operative in institutions, the performance of some act A by agent x counts as a means of creating state of affairs B. When combined with deontic and action logics, the new connective facilitates the analysis of a number of notions crucial to the understanding of organised interaction in institutions, such as authoriso.tzon and delegation. We conclude with some illustrations of the expressive power of the new logical language.},

 abstract     = {When a C programmer needs an efficient data structure for a particular prob- lem, he or she can often simply look one up in any of a number of good text- books or handbooks. Unfortunately, programmers in functional languages such as Standard ML or Haskell do not have this luxury. Although some data struc- tures designed for imperative languages such as C can be quite easily adapted to a functional setting, most cannot, usually because they depend in crucial ways on as- signments, which are disallowed, or at least discouraged, in functional languages. To address this imbalance, we describe several techniques for designing functional data structures, and numerous original data structures based on these techniques, including multiple variations of lists, queues, double-ended queues, and heaps, many supporting more exotic features such as random access or efficient catena- tion. In addition, we expose the fundamental role of lazy evaluation in amortized functional data structures. Traditional methods of amortization break down when old versions of a data structure, not just the most recent, are available for further processing. This property is known as persistence, and is taken for granted in functional languages. On the surface, persistence and amortization appear to be incompatible, butwe showhow lazy evaluation can be used to resolve this conflict, yielding amortized data structures that are efficient even when used persistently. Turning this relationship between lazy evaluation and amortization around, the notion of amortization also provides the first practical techniques for analyzing the time requirements of non-trivial lazy programs. Finally, our data structures offer numerous hints to programming language de- signers, illustrating the utility of combining strict and lazy evaluation in a single language, and providing non-trivial examples using polymorphic recursion and higher-order, recursive modules.},

 abstract     = {Real-world applications that are ideal for robotic solutions are very complex and challenging. Many of these applications are set in dynamic environments that require capabilities distributed in functionality, space or time. These applications, therefore, often require teams of robots to work together cooperatively to successfully address the mission. While much research in recent years has addressed the issues of autonomous robots and multi-robot cooperation, current robotics technology is still far from achieving many of these real world applications. We believe that two primary reasons for this technology gap are that (1) previous work has not adequately addressed the issues of fault tolerance and adaptivity in multi-robot teams, and (2) existing robotics research is often geared at specific applications and is not easily generalized to different, but related, applications. This paper addresses these issues by first describing the design issues of key importance in these real-world cooperative robotics...},

 abstract     = {One of the key steps in creating quality interactive drama is the ability to create quality interactive characters (or believable agents). Two important aspects of such characters will be that they appear emotional and that they can engage in social interactions. My basic approach to these problems has been to use a broad agent architecture and minimal amounts of modeling of other agent in the environment. This approach is based on an understanding of the artistic nature of the problem. To enable agent-builders (artists) to create emotional agents, I provide a general framework for building emotional agents, default emotion-processing rules, and discussion about how to create quality, emotional characters. My framework gets a lot of its power from being part of a broad agent architecture. The concept is simple: the agent will be emotionally richer if there are more things to have emotions about and more ways to express them. This reliance on breadth has also meant that I have been able to create simple emotion models that rely on perception and motivation instead of deep modeling of other agents and complex cognitive processing. To enable agent builders to create social behaviors for believable agents, I have designed a methodology that provides heuristics for social behaviors and suggests how to model other agents in the environment. I propose an approach to modeling other agents that calls for limiting the amount of modeling of other agents to that which is sufficient to create the desired behavior. Using this technique, I have been able to build robust social behaviors that use surprisingly little representation. I have used this methodology to build a number of social behaviors, like negotiation and making friends. I have built three simulations containing seven agents to drive and test this work. I have also conducted user studies to demonstrate that these agents appear to be emotional and can engage in non-trivial social interactions while also being good characters with distinct personalities.},
