We attempt to move discussion beyond the debate over the scope of problems that can be handled e ectively to cases where it is clear that there are in- sucient computational resources to perform an analysis deemed as complete. Under these conditions, we stress the importance of considering the expected costs and bene ts of applying alternative approximation procedures and heuristics for computation and knowledge acquisition. We discuss how knowledge about the structure of user utility can be used to control value tradeo s for tailoring inference to alternative contexts. We address the notion of real-time rationality, focusing on the application of knowledge about the expected timewise-re nement abilities of reasoning strategies to balance the bene ts of additional computation with the costs of acting with a partial result. We dis- cuss the bene ts of applying decision theory to control the solution of dicult problems given limitations and uncertainty in reasoning resources.},

 abstract     = {In an important series of papers [8, 9], Brian Smith has discussed the nature of programs that know about their text and the context in which they are executed. He called this kind of knowledge reflection. Smith proposed a programming language, called -LISP, which embodied such self-knowledge in the domain of metacircular interpreters. Every -LISP program is interpreted by a metacircular interpreter, also written in -LISP. This gives rise to a picture of an infinite tower of metacircular interpreters, each being interpreted by the one above it. Such a metaphor poses a serious challenge for conventional modes of understanding of programming languages. In our earlier work on reflection [4], we showed how a useful species of reflection could be modeled without the use of towers. In this paper, we give a semantic account of the reflective tower. This account is self-contained in the sense that it does not em- ploy reflection to explain reflection.},
