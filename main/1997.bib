 abstract     = {Can computer games be great literature? Do the rapidly evolving and culturally expanding genres of digital literature mean that the narrative mode of discourse - novels, films, television series - is losing its dominant position in our culture? Is it necessary to define a new aesthetics of cyborg textuality? In Cybertext, Espen Aarseth explores the aesthetics and textual dynamics of digital literature and its diverse genres, including hypertext fiction, computer games, computer-generated poetry and prose, and collaborative Internet texts such as MUDs. Instead of insisting on the uniqueness and newness of electronic writing and interactive fiction, however, Aarseth situates these literary forms within the tradition of “ergodic” literature-a term borrowed from physics to describe open, dynamic texts such as the I Ching or Apollinaire's calligrams, with which the reader must perform specific actions to generate a literary sequence.Constructing a theoretical model that describes how new electronic forms build on this tradition, Aarseth bridges the widely assumed divide between paper texts and electronic texts. He then uses the perspective of ergodic aesthetics to reexamine literary theories of narrative, semiotics, and rhetoric and to explore the implications of applying these theories to materials for which they were not intended.{	extquotedblright}In many respects, this is the book I and many others have been waiting for. I have not seen any work so comprehensive in its synthesis of previous commentary. Aarseth's brilliant observations remind me of McLuhan's 'probes'-highly condensed, provocative statements meant to generate controversy and insight. This is clearly the best study of electronic texts I have yet read.{	extquotedblright}-Stuart Moulthrop, University of Baltimore, author of Victory Garden},

Through close attention to the metaphors of AI and their consequences for the field's patterns of success and failure, it argues for a reorientation of the field away from thought in the head and toward activity in the world. By considering computational ideas in a philosophical framework, the author eases critical dialogue between technology and the humanities and social sciences. AI can benefit from new understandings of human nature, and in return, it offers a powerful mode of investigation into the practicalities and consequences of physical realization.},

 abstract     = {This study was designed to validate an in vivo measurement of the functional sensitivity of basal ganglia neuronal circuits containing dopamine D2 receptors. We hypothesized that a D2 agonist would decrease striatopallidal neuronal activity, and hence regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) over the axon terminals in the globus pallidus. Quantitative pallidal blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with bolus injections of H215O and arterial sampling in six baboons before and after intravenous administration of the selective D2 agonist U91356a. We also tested whether the response to U91356a was modified by previous acute administration of various antagonists. Another baboon had serial measurements of blood flow under identical conditions, but received no dopaminergic drugs. In all animals that received U91356a, pallidal flow decreased in a dose-related manner. Global CBF had a similar response, but the decline in pallidal flow was greater in magnitude and remained significant after accounting for the global effect. A D2 antagonist, but not antagonists of D1, serotonin-2, or peripheral D2 receptors, prevented this decrease. This work demonstrates and validates an in vivo measure of the sensitivity of D2-mediated basal ganglia pathways. It also supports the hypothesis that activation of the indirect striatopallidal pathway, previously demonstrated using nonselective D2-like agonists, can be mediated specifically by D2 receptors. We speculate that the U91356a-PET technique may prove useful in detecting functional abnormalities of D2-mediated dopaminergic function in diseases such as parkinsonism, dystonia, Tourette syndrome, or schizophrenia.},

 abstract     = {A theory describing the development of alternating, dissociated, victim/masochistic and perpetrator/sadistic ego states in persons who grew up with abusive primary caretakers will be proposed and a paradigm for treatment will be derived from the theory. Alternating ego states can be observed throughout the spectrum of dissociative disorders, from Borderline Personality to Dissociative Identity Disorder. Dependence on an abusive caretaker creates a series of relational dilemmas for the child. To maintain attachment, abuse must be dissociated, but to protect the self from abuse, need for attachment must be disavowed. Disorganized attachment may result. Incompatible internal working models, using parallel masochistic and sadistic defensive strategies, may be developed and elaborated into ego states. Masochistic and sadistic defenses are ultimately maladaptive, because they require dissociation of need for either self-protection or attachment. Each defensive attempt at resolving a relational dilemma leads to another impasse, a change in defensive strategy, and perhaps a shift in ego state. When alternating ego states are understood as evolving from defensive schemas developed to negotiate the dilemmas of attachment to an abuser, the following therapeutic techniques can be derived: (1) identifying adaptive needs and maladaptive defenses, (2) interpreting ego state switches as attempts to resolve relational dilemmas, (3) gradually bridging dissociation between states, (4) using transference and countertransference to understand relational patterns, and (5) cultivating more adaptive interpersonal skills within the therapeutic relationship. {	extcopyright}2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

 abstract     = {The central premise of this book is that computer games constitute a new and as yet poorly developed art form that holds great promise for both designers and players. This premise may seem laughable or flippant. How could anybody classify the likes of SPACE INVADERS and PAC MAN as art? How can TEMPEST or MISSILE COMMAND compare with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Michelangelo's Pieta, or Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms? Computer games are too trivial, too frivolous to be called art. They are idle recreation at best. So says the skeptic. But we cannot relegate computer games to the cesspit of pop culture solely on the evidence of the current crop of games. The industry is too young and the situation is too dynamic for us to dismiss computer games so easily. We must consider the potential, not the actuality. We must address the fundamental aspects of computer games to achieve a conclusion that will withstand the ravages of time and change. There are many definitions of art, few of which make much sense to the uninitiated. I will present my own pedestrian definition: art is something designed to evoke emotion through fantasy. The artist presents his audience with a set of sensory experiences that stimulates commonly shared fantasies, and so generates emotions. Art is made possible only by the richness of the fantasy world we share. Art is nevertheless difficult, because there are so many practical problems associated with stimulating fantasies deep inside another person's mind. A major problem is getting the attention or participation of the audience. Most art allows very little participation. You sit quietly and listen to music that other people created and perform, or you stroll through a museum and stare at pictures or statues other people made. You sit passively and read a novel, or a poem, or a short story. With all of these art forms, the role of the audience is passive. The artist does all the active work, makes the biggest emotional investment. The audience is expected to absorb quietly the fruits of the artist's exertions. Active participation is severely curtailed. Without participation, attention dwindles and impact crumbles away. This is in no wise a criticism of art or artists. The technologies of art preclude participation. If we had every klutz jump into the orchestra pit, or prance on the opera stage, or slop paint with Picasso, we would have some great parties but no art. it seems the curse of art that artists can say so much in their work and most people will hear so little because they cannot participate in the art. Enter the computer. Conceived long ago, born in war, reared as the servant of business, this now adolescent technology has exploded out of the computer room and invaded shopping centers, pizza parlors, and homes. Popular characterizations of the computer alternate between the old image of the computer as omniscient, cold blooded, giant calculator, and the new image of the computer as purveyor of video thrills and 25 cent fixes. Originally developed as a number cruncher, the computer assumed a new personality when it was given graphics and sound capabilities. These capabilities gave the computer a powerful asset: it could now communicate with the human, not just in the cold and distant language of digits, but in the emotionally immediate and compelling language of images and sounds. With this capability came a new, previously undreamed of possibility: the possibility of using the computer as a medium for emotional communication art. The computer game has emerged as the prime vehicle for this medium. The computer game is an art form because it presents its audience with fantasy experiences that stimulate emotion. Unfortunately, the current generation of microcomputers cannot produce a sensory experience as rich as that produced by, say, a symphony orchestra or a movie. This weakness is more than offset by a fundamental advantage lacking in most other art forms: a game is intrinsically participatory in nature. The artist has here a tool that is more subtly indirect than traditional art. With other art forms, the artist directly creates the experience that the audience will encounter. Since this experience is carefully planned and executed, the audience must somehow be prevented from disturbing it; hence, non participation. With a game, the artist creates not the experience itself but the conditions and rules under which the audience will create its own individualized experience. The demand on the artist is greater, for s/he must plan the experience indirectly, taking into account the probable and possible actions and reactions of the audience. The return is far greater, for participation increases attention and heightens the intensity of the experience. When we passively observe someone else's artistic presentation, we derive some emotional benefit, but when we actively participate in a game, we invest a portion of our own ego into the fantasy world of the game. This more sizable investment of participation yields a commensurately greater return of emotional satisfaction. Indeed, the role of participation is so important that many people derive greater satisfaction from participating in an amateur artistic effort than from observing a professional effort. Hence, games, being intrinsically participatory, present the artist with a fantastic opportunity for reaching people. Until now, games in general and computer games in particular have not been very impressive as art forms. The computer games especially are downright puerile. This is because the technology of computer games has been in the hands of technologists, not artists. These guys (and they are almost all male) can write beautiful operating systems, languages, linking loaders, and other technological wonders, but artistic flair has heretofore been treated as subordinate to technical prowess. Another contributor to the fecklessness of our current computer games is the timidity of the marketplace. These machines are new; the public is unfamiliar with them and the manufacturers are hesitant to press the public too hard too fast. We therefore opt to build inhibited little games pathetically whispering some trivial emotion. Truly intense emotions or situations such as pathos, ecstasy, majesty, rapture, catharsis, or tragedy intimidate use. We hide behind the defense that we are in the entertainment business, not the art business, but that defense only betrays a profound misunderstanding of art. Art can be starchily elitist, but good art can also be a foot stomping blast. Elitism arises from the intellectual content of art; impact springs from its emotional honesty. Fortunately, times are changing. Already, we see a backlash developing against computer games. It expresses itself in many ways: in ordinances against the placement of arcade games in some areas, in statements by educators denouncing the games, and in more vigilant regulation of children's game activities by parents. This backlash is viewed by smaller minded members of the industry with anxiety. More visionary thinkers watch the backlash with eager interest rather than defensiveness. The American people are telling us something here, something very important. It is imporant enough to them that they are willing to compromise their traditional reluctance to interfere with other people's business. While the arguments presented in public debates normally focus on formal issues such as delinquency from school, creation of large groups of rowdy teenagers, and so forth, the concerns expressed privately reflect a distaste for the games, a vague suspicion that the games are a waste of time. You can't fool all of the people all of the time; they are beginning to realize that the world of computer games is as yet a vast wasteland. Computer games are much like candy, comic books, and cartoons. All four activities provide intense or exaggerated experiences. Whether they use sugar, exclamation points, or animated explosions, the goal is the same: to provide extreme experiences. Children appreciate these activities because their novelty value is still strong. Adults, jaded by years of experience with such things, prefer diversions with greater subtlety and depth. We thus have the panoply of culinary achievement, the vast array of literature, and the universe of movies as the adult counterparts to candy, comic books, and cartoons. Yet, we have no adult counterpart to computer games. This deficit is pregnant with possibilities, for it suggests a momentous upheaval in computer game design. This developing revolution has nothing to do with the rapid technological developments of the last few years. While technological improvements will surely continue, we are no longer hampered primarily by the limitations of the hardware. Our primary problem is that we have little theory on which to base our efforts. We don't really know what a game is, or why people play games, or what makes a game great. Real art through computer games is achievable, but it will never be achieved so long as we have no path to understanding. We need to establish our principles of aesthetics, a framework for criticism, and a model for development. New and better hardware will improve our games, but it will not guarantee our artistic success any more than the development of orchestras guaranteed the appearance of Beethoven. We are a long way from a computer game comparable to a Shakespeare play, a Tchaikowsky symphony, or a Van Gogh self portrait. Each of these artists stood on the shoulders of earlier artists who plunged into an unexplored world and mapped out its territories so that later artists could build on their work and achieve greater things. We computer game designers must put our shoulders together so that our successors may stand on top of them. This book is my contribution to that enterprise.},

At-tempting such a synthesis, we develop a theoretical framework for explaining norm emergence and change that builds on Barth's idea of generative models. We identify three mechanisms offered in the contemporary theoretical literature to account for the dy-namic process of norm change: (i) coordination on focal points, (2) competitive selection among contracts, and (3) bargaining. We investigate three examples of norm change among the Galole Orma-common property rights, bridewealth, and clan exog-amy-and show that examination of strategic decision making within the constraints presented by social context can produce adequate accounts of such change. We conclude that the primary mechanism in norm change among the Orma is bargaining and that the most important sources of such change are asymmetries in bargaining power.},

This evaluation encompasses seven generic tasks and leads to insightful recommendations for the representation of graphs according to their size and density. Typically, we show that when graphs are bigger than twenty vertices, the matrix-based visualization outperforms node-link diagrams on most tasks. Only path finding is consistently in favor of node-link diagrams throughout the evaluation.},

Ways in which a literary analogy can interact with considerations about the arousal of emotion and with considerations about the ascription of emotions to music are discussed. Several essays are examined for their relation to the traditional aesthetic dichotomy between emotional aspects of music and technical or formal solutions. In this specific comparison, Treitler's essay emerges as more challenging and innovative than the others.},

 abstract     = {In the software and knowledge engineering literature we can find maintenance strategies offered to maintain seven main types of knowledge: words; sentences; behavioral knowledge; and meta-knowledge. Meta-knowledge divides into problem solving methods, quality knowledge, fix knowledge, social knowledge and processing activities. There are five main ways in which these seven knowledge types are processed: acquire, operationalize, fault, fix and preserve. We review systems that contribute to these 7 * 5 = 35 types of knowledge maintenance to make the following conclusions. First, open issues with the current maintenance research are identified. These include (a) areas that are not being addressed by any researcher; (b) the recursive maintenance problem; and (c) drawbacks with rapid acquire systems and the operationalization KM assumption. Secondly, a process is described for commissioning a new maintenance tool. Thirdly, a general common principle for maintenance (search-space reflection) is isolated.},

These actions are considered as classes of cognitive practices that are simultaneously available to the actor and others in a shared physical workspace. The public availability of these actions to the perceptions of the participants in a cooperative process enables their communicative functions A taxonomy of embodied actions is developed as a bridging structure between the field study of cooperative work and the design of technology that might support that work over distance. Boundaries are drawn by mapping practices; “objects” do not pre-exist as such. Objects are boundary projects. But boundaries shift from within; boundaries are very tricky. What boundaries provisionally contain remains generative, productive of meanings and bodies. Siting (sighting) boundaries is a risky practice. Donna Haraway, Situated Knowledges, 1991, p. 200},
