 abstract     = {Comprehensive approaches to knowledge management in modern enterprises are confronted with scenarios which are heterogeneous, distributed, and dynamic by nature. Pro-active satisfaction of information needs across intra-organizational boundaries requires dynamic negotiation of shared understanding and adaptive handling of changing and ad-hoc task contexts. In this paper, we present the notion of a Distributed Organizational Memory (DOM) as a meta-information system with multiple ontology-based structures and a workflow-based context representation. We argue that agent technology offers the software basis which is necessary to realize DOM systems. We sketch a comprehensive Framework for Distributed Organizational Memories which enables the implementation of scalable DOM solutions and supports the principles of agent-mediated knowledge management.},

 abstract     = {In this tongue-in-cheek commentary the author takes a serious look at the problem of translating ethnographic conclusions into simple functions as a means to the end of building an agent-based simulation in the Netlogo language. Specifically, the goal is to take the simple fact that stories about illicit drugs have a lot to do with whether or not they will be used and see if an agent-based model can produce an epidemic incidence curve under the appropriate conditions. This commentary has less to do with the model and more to do with figuring out what kinds of numbers make sense. Based on the principle that mathematical ignorance is bliss, the author concludes that the most important thing is that number construction reflects the differences that make a difference in the ethnographic work, where the discovery of what the significant differences in fact were was a major result of the research.

 abstract     = {In hundreds of articles by experts from around the world, and in overviews and {\textquotedblleft}road maps{\textquotedblright} prepared by the editor, The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks charts the immense progress made in recent years in many specific areas related to two great questions: How does the brain work? and How can we build intelligent machines? While many books have appeared on limited aspects of one subfield or another of brain theory and neural networks, the Handbook covers the entire sweep of topics-from detailed models of single neurons, analyses of a wide variety of biological neural networks, and connectionist studies of psychology and language, to mathematical analyses of a variety of abstract neural networks, and technological applications of adaptive, artificial neural networks. The excitement, and the frustration, of these topics is that they span such a broad range of disciplines including mathematics, statistical physics and chemistry, neurology and neurobiology, and computer science and electrical engineering as well as cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. Thus, much effort has gone into making the Handbook accessible to readers with varied backgrounds while still providing a clear view of much of the recent, specialized research in specific topics. The heart of the book, part III, comprises of 267 original articles by leaders in the various fields, arranged alphabetically by title. Parts I and II, written by the editor, are designed to help readers orient themselves to this vast range of material. Part I, Background, introduces several basic neural models, explains how the present study of brain theory and neural networks integrates brain theory, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology, and provides a tutorial on the concepts essential for understanding neural networks as dynamic, adaptive systems. Part II, Road Maps, provides entry into the many articles of part III through an introductory {\textquotedblleft}Meta-Map{\textquotedblright} and twenty-three road maps, each of which tours all the Part III articles on the chosen theme.},

We viewed computational systems from an external perspective, with a focus on the institutional and the social aspects of these systems. The social constraints and roles of the open societies were specified with the use of the Event Calculus. In this paper, we formalise our frame- work with the use of the C+ language, a formalism with explicit state transition semantics. We use the implementation of the C+ language, the Causal Calculator, a software tool for representing commonsense knowledge about action and change, to animate and validate the spec- ifications of computational societies. We demonstrate the utility of the Causal Calculator (by specifying and executing a Contract-Net Pro- tocol) and comment on its functionality regarding the specification of computational societies.},

The former is that even simple predictions developed to anticipate future state of affairs have an intrinsic tendency to evolve in full expectations and then in prescriptions. We consider this as a multilevel phenomenon occurring either at the individual psychological level or at the interpersonal one or, finally, at the collective macro social level. The latter thesis is that we consider this tendency as one of the possible paths of the spontaneous emergence of agents commitments, of conventions and likely of real social norms: the tacit emergence of a prescriptive character and, then, of obligations and duties. We will examine the constitutive elements both cognitive and relational  of this process of spontaneous transition from the predictive attitudes to the prescriptive ones and, on this basis, to real normative attitudes. Finally, we will discuss the inevitably normative component of conventions as traditionally described (Lewis 1969). We will argue that this fundamental process is notably left implicit or insufficiently explained.},

This dissertation explores the lives and relationships of 33 individuals (consisting of 17 heterosexual couples) who defined themselves as active participants in the BDSM lifestyle. Each couple has been in a committed relationship and has practiced sadomasochistic and/or dominant and submissive behaviors as a regular part of their relationship. The relationships are examined in general, how they met and selected each other, the power dynamics within the relationship, and the nature of sexual/SM bargaining within and outside of a BDSM context.},

Often, visual awareness is equated to what is in the focus of attention. There are, however, two sets of arguments to separate attention from awareness: a psychological/theoretical one and a neurobiological one. By combining these arguments I present definitions of visual attention and awareness that clearly distinguish between the two, yet explain why attention and awareness are so intricately related. In fact, there seems more overlap between mechanisms of memory and awareness than between those of attention and awareness.},

In this study we examined the extent to which pluralistic ignorance affects hooking up. One hundred thirty-six female and 128 male college students answered questions regarding their own comfort and their perceived peers'comfort in engaging in a variety of sexual behaviors while hooking up. We hypothesized and found that both women and men rated their peers as being more comfortable engaging in these behaviors than they rated themselves. Men expressed more comfort than did women in engaging in these behaviors, and both sexes overestimated the other gender's comfort with hooking up behaviors. Pluralistic ignorance appears to apply to hooking up on college campuses, and we explore some potential consequences of pluralistic ignorance in this context.},

 abstract     = {The difference between 'artistic and literary fields' and universes such as architecture usually recognized as 'art professions' but which enjoy a far lesser 'degree of autonomy' than such fields seemingly constitutes an obstacle to the broader application of the notion of a 'field of cultural production' sought by Bourdieu in his Rules of Art. The author of this paper overcomes this obstacle by employing his notion of the 'field effect', with the architecture competition serving as the test case. Following Bourdieu, the author replaces the notion of profession with that of the field, for the former is a representation fostered by professional groups themselves. Architecture is a field, but, because architects require clients to construct and realize their works, one unlike the artistic and literary fields, which are markets of symbolic goods where 'distinterest' reigns and an autonomy unthinkable elsewhere is enjoyed. However, much like artists and unlike any other 'professionals', architects enter competitions, suggesting that this practice is an analytically relevant indicator of the field effect. After defining several of the elements of Bourdieu's relational conceptual matrix (field, illusio, collusion, doxa and space of possibles) and demonstrating that the Baptistery competition in Florence (1401) conforms to Bourdieu's historical beginning point for the process of 'autonomization' of artistic production, I examine a number of competitions from 1401 to 1989 (Berlin Jewish Museum) along with the general properties of competitions (structure and organization, publication and exhibition of results, com- petitors' economically irrational behaviour, practices of designers and jurors and the associated universe of beliefs), analysing them as those of an artistic field. It is concluded that when architects enter competitions, architecture, at least provisionally resembles an artistic field, for there is a field effect shown by a high degree autonomy, disinterest and the creation of an upside-down world},

 abstract     = {Field theory is a more or less coherent approach in the social sciences whose essence is the explanation of regularities in individual action by recourse to position vis-\`a-vis others. Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges {\textquotedblleft}from the inside{\textquotedblright} as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of {\textquotedblleft}explanation{\textquotedblright} that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage.},

The experiment varied the level of anthropomorphism of the image of interactants: high anthropomorphism, low anthropomorphism, or no image. Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases telepresence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those inter-acting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.},

 abstract     = {Researchers inComputerSupported CooperativeWorkhave recently developed discount evaluation methods for shared-workspace groupware. Most discount methods rely on some understanding of the context in which the groupware systems will be used, which means that evaluators need to model the tasks that groups will perform. However, existing task analysis schemes are not well suited to the needs of groupware evaluation: they either do not deal with collaboration issues, do not use an appropriate level of analysis for concrete assessment of usability in interfaces, or do not adequately represent the variability inherent in group work. To fill this gap, we have developed a new modeling technique called Collaboration Usability Analysis. CUA focuses on the teamwork that goes on in a group task rather than the taskwork. To enable closer links between the task representation and the groupware interface, CUA grounds each collaborative action in a set of group work primitives called the mechanics of collaboration. To represent the range of ways that a group task can be carried out, CUA allows variable paths through the execution of a task, and allows alternate paths and optional tasks to be modeled. CUA's main contribution is to provide evaluators with a framework in which they can simulate the realistic use of a groupware system and identify usability problems that are caused by the groupware interface.

SNIF-ACT selects actions based on the measure of information scent, which is calculated by a spreading activation mechanism that captures the mutual relevance of the contents of a WWW page to the goal of the user. There are two main predictions of SNIF-ACT: (1) users working on unfamiliar tasks are expected to choose links that have high information scent, (2) users will leave a site when the information scent of the site diminishes below a certain threshold. SNIF-ACT produced good fits to data collected from four users working on two tasks each. The results suggest that the current content-based spreading activation SNIF-ACT model is able to generate useful predictions about complex user-WWW interactions.},

When users detected a strong information scent, they were able to reach their goal faster with the Hyperbolic Tree browser than with a conventional browser. When users detected a weak scent or no scent, users exhibited less efficient search of areas with a high density of visual items. In order to interpret these results we present an integration of the CODE Theory of Visual Attention (CTVA) with information foraging theory. Development of the CTVA-foraging theory could lead to deeper analysis of interaction with visual displays of content, such as the World Wide Web or information visualizations.},

We identify general trends comparing novice and expert programmers, programming knowledge and strategies, program generation and comprehension, and objectoriented versus procedural programming. (We do not cover research relating specifically to other programming styles.) The main focus of the review is on novice programming and topics relating to novice teaching and learning. Various problems experienced by novices are identified, including issues relating to basic program design, to algorithmic complexity in certain language features, to the {\textquotedblleft}fragility' ' of novice knowledge, and so on. We summarise this material and suggest some practical implications for teachers. We suggest that a key issue that emerges is the distinction between effective and ineffective novices. What characterises effective novices? Is it possible to identify the specific deficits of ineffective novices and help them to become effective learners of programming? 1.},

Each chapter contains an extensive bibliography of the major writings in the field. Among the topics covered are the philosophy of logic, of mathematics and of Gottlob Frege; Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus; a survey of logical positivism; the philosophy of physics and of science; probability theory, cybernetics and an essay on the mechanist/vitalist debates. In addition to these papers, the volume contains a helpful chronology to the major scientific and philosophical events in the twentieth century. It also provides an extensive glossary of technical terms in the philosophy of science, logic and mathematics, and brief biographical notes on major figures in these fields.},

To aid this design process, a method is developed to encapsulate the constraints of sheet metal that make designing such components a tedious and iterative procedure. This project involves the implementation and testing of a geometric representation scheme for building feasible sheet metal components through the use of 17 grammar rules that capture manufacturing operations like cutting and bending. The implemented system has benefits both as a user interaction tool and as the basis for a computational design synthesis approach for designing sheet metal components. An example of a constructed sheet metal component is shown along with the method for invoking the sheet metal grammar to create this component.},

Two different control mechanisms including semantic (content-based) filtering of messages and in-stream transformation of messages driven by policies at run-time are discussed. These mechanisms allow a more fine-grained control over dynamic and autonomous agent interactions and increases the confidence of system designers to adopt agent-based approaches in building dynamic, heterogeneous systems. Semantic filtering protects sensitive data transmission from agents of one country to the rest of the coalition members and dynamic transformation reduces the resolution of a data feed from a sensor agent of one country to a client agent in another country.},

Competition is therefore regarded a key element of the explanation of players' entertainment experience. Subsequent to a theoretical explication, empirical evidence for the role of competition in the playing process and the impact of competitiveness for selective exposure to computer games is reported from a field experiment (N = 349) and an online survey study (N = 795).},

Through the adaptive nature of the design grammar used, the created building designs can either be generic or adhere closely to a specified goal, depending on the amount of data available.},
