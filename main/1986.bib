 abstract     = {In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse. In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interre- lated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a struc- ture of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utter- ances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored. This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse. Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and track- ing the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants' knowledge of the domain.},

 abstract     = {The dissertation is a feasibility study for an interactive fantasy system that enables a human user to participate as a character in a real-time, interactive drama. Such a system must have the ability to understand the words, actions, and goals of the user-character and to formulate and enact a dramatically interesting plot. The study applies the principles of Aristotelian dramatic theory to interactive structure. Dramatic theory provides the system's end cause, the formal and structural qualities of its output, and the organizing principles for its design. Major emphasis is placed on the dramatic theory and techniques that must be embodied in the systems as a whole, and in its playwriting expertise in particular. A crucial distinction between narrative literature and drama is the way in which each is experienced: narrative literature is intended to be read, while drama is intended to be enacted. Dramatic enactment directly involves the visual and auditory senses as well as the mind; accordingly, an interactive drama must unfold in several modalities. Diverse technologies may be employed, including speech recognition, non-verbal sensing techniques, natural-language processing, expert systems, voice synthesis, digital sound production, and “intelligent” computer animation. The capabilities and limitations of various component technologies are examined and a system design is proposed that orchestrates their performance to achieve the desired end. The study develops the theoretical basis for an interactive fantasy system, identifies its functional requirements, proposes a structural model for the system as a whole, and explores in depth the design of a {	extquotedblleft}playwriting expert{	extquotedblright} that operates as the central intelligence of the system. The study demonstrates that an interactive fantasy system is feasible in terms of both dramatic theory and technology. The potential uses of such a system are explored, including applications in research, entertainment, and learning.},
