 abstract     = {In most of the existing approaches to the design of multi- agent systems, there is no clear way in which to relate organisational and normative structures to the model of the environment where they are to be situated and operate. Our work addresses this problem by putting together, in a practical approach to developing multi-agent systems (and social simulations in particular), a high-level environment mod- elling language that incorporates aspects of agents, organ- isations, and normative structures. The paper explains in some detail how the ideas of normative objects and nor- mative places, put together as a distributed normative infrastructure, allow the definition of certain kinds of situ- ated multi-agent organisations, in particular organisations for multi-agent systems that operate within concrete envi- ronments. Normative objects are environment objects used to explicitly convey normative content that regulate the behaviour of agents within the place where such objects can be perceived by agents. The paper briefly introduces such concepts, showing how they were integrated into the MAS- SOCmulti-agent systems platform for social simulation, and hints on new problems of (situated) organisational and nor- mative structures that were brought forward by the work presented here.},

Recently, tagging has grown popular as an alternative means of organizing information resources. We argue that tagging is a powerful paradigm for efficient information access which overcomes many deficiencies of hierarchical file systems, especially in the context of the organization of large quantities of personal files. In this paper we present TagFS, a filesystem with tagging support which aims at a seamless integration of the tagging paradigm with local applications. While retaining the notions of directories and files and providing all standard filesystem operations, the semantics of these primitives are changed to modifications of the tag annotations.},

 abstract     = {Logical architectures combine several logics into a more complex logical system. In this paper we study a logical architecture using input/output operations corresponding to the functionality of logical components. We illustrate how the architectural approach can be used to develop a logic of a normative system based on logics of counts-as conditionals, institutional constraints, obligations and permissions. In this example we adapt for counts-as conditionals and institutional constraints a proposal of Jones and Sergot, and for obligations and permissions we adapt the input/output logic framework of Makinson and van der Torre. We use our architecture to study logical relations among counts-as conditionals, institutional constraints, obligations and permissions. We show that in our logical architecture the combined system of counts-as conditionals and institutional constraints reduces to the logic of institutional constraints, which again reduces to an expression in the underlying base logic. Counts-as conditionals and institutional constraints are defined as a pre-processing step for the regulative norms. Permissions are defined as exceptions to obligations and their interaction is characterized.},

A recurring issue in statistical physics is how best to approximate joint probability distributions with decoupled (and therefore far more tractable) distributions. This paper shows that the same information theoretic mathematical structure, known as Product Distribution (PD) theory, addresses both issues. In this, PD theory not only provides a principled formulation of bounded rationality and a set of new types of mean field theory in statistical physics. It also shows that those topics are fundamentally one and the same. ©2006 Springer.},

 abstract     = {Kathy Charmaz is one of the world's leading theorists and exponents of grounded theory. In this important and essential new textbook, she introduces the reader to the craft of using grounded theory in social research, and provides a clear, step-by-step guide for those new to the field. Using worked examples throughout, this book also maps out an alternative vision of grounded theory put forward by its founding thinkers, Glaser and Strauss. To Charmaz, grounded theory must move on from its positivist origins and must incorporate many of the methods and questions posed by constructivists over the past twenty years to become a more nuanced and reflexive practice.},

We propose a framework for the classification of several existing and proposed model transformation approaches. The classification framework is given as a feature model that makes explicit the different design choices for model transformations. Based on our analysis of model transformation approaches, we propose a few major categories in which most approaches fit.},

 abstract     = {A long-held belief among mental health practitioners is that being born unwanted carries a risk of negative psychosocial development and poor mental health in adulthood. The Prague Study was designed to test this hypothesis. It followed the development and mental well-being of 220 children (now adults) born in 1961-63 in Prague to women twice denied abortion for the same unwanted pregnancy. The children were individually pair-matched at about age nine with 220 children born from accepted pregnancies when no abortion had been requested. This article brings together in one place the theoretical assumptions and hypotheses, the criteria for selecting the study participants and major findings from five follow-up waves conducted among the children around the ages of 9, 14-16, 21-23, 28-31 and 32-35 years, plus a sub-study of married unwanted pregnancy subjects and accepted pregnancy controls at ages 26-28. To control for potential confounding factors in data interpretation, all siblings of all subjects were included in the last two waves. It was found that differences in psychosocial development widened over time but lessened at around age 30. All the differences consistently disfavoured the unwanted pregnancy subjects, especially only children (no siblings). They became psychiatric patients (especially in-patients) more frequently than the accepted pregnancy controls and also more often than their siblings. The overall findings suggest that, in the aggregate, denial of abortion for unwanted pregnancy entails an increased risk for negative psychosocial development and mental well-being in adulthood. ©2006 Reproductive Health Matters.},

JavaCOP enforces user-defined typing constraints written in a declarative and expressive rule language. We have validated our design by (re)implementing a range of type systems and program checkers. By using a program constraint system to implement pluggable types, programmers are able to check that their programs will operate correctly in restricted environments, adhere to strict programming rules, avoid null pointer errors or scoped memory exceptions, and meet style guidelines, while programming language researchers can easily experiment with novel type systems.},

In this paper, we use longitudinal data collected directly from the game to examine play and grouping patterns in one of the largest MMOGs: World of Warcraft. Our observations show that the prevalence and extent of social activities in MMOGs might have been previously over-estimated, and that gaming communities face important challenges affecting their cohesion and eventual longevity. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future games and other online social spaces.},

The aim of this study is to show how meaning making is achieved in the context of one's life and how this achievement is often a struggle for the individual. The study reports data from semi-structured interviews with a female participant, which was analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). This paper examines how cultural discourses and conventions are experienced and given meaning by the individual. First, the analysis demonstrates how dominant discourses are used to explain anger and aggression. These include hormones, alcohol, and the influence of past relationships on present action. Second, it examines how the participant's meaning making is often ambiguous and confused, and how she variously accepts and challenges available meanings. Finally, the analysis demonstrates how meaning making can break down and the consequences of this for the individual's sense of self.},

 abstract     = {In order to regulate different circumstances over an extensive period of time, norms in institutions are stated in a vague and often ambiguous manner, thereby abstracting from concrete aspects which become instead relevant for the actual functioning of the institutions. If agent-based electronic institutions, which adhere to a set of abstract requirements, are to be built, how can those requirements be translated into more concrete constraints, the impact of which can be described directly in the institution? We address this issue considering institutions as normative systems based on articulate ontologies of the agent domain they regulate. Ontologies, we hold, are used by institutions to relate the abstract concepts in which their norms are formulated, to their concrete application domain. In this view, different institutions can implement the same set of norms in different ways as far as they presuppose divergent ontologies of the concepts in which that set of norms is formulated. In this paper we analyse this phenomenon introducing a notion of contextual ontology. We will focus on the formal machinery necessary to characterise it as well.},

 abstract     = {Organizational sociologists often treat institutions as macro cultural logics, representations, and schemata, with less consideration for how institutions are “inhabited” (Scully and Creed, 1997) by people doing things together. As such, this article uses a symbolic interactionist rereading of Gouldner's classic study Patterns of Industrial Bureaucracy as a lever to expand the boundaries of institutionalism to encompass a richer understanding of action, interaction, and meaning. Fifty years after its publication, Gouldner's study still speaks to us, though in ways we (and he) may not have anticipated five decades ago. The rich field observations in Patterns remind us that institutions such as bureaucracy are inhabited by people and their interactions, and the book provides an opportunity for intellectual renewal. Instead of treating contemporary institutionalism and symbolic interaction as antagonistic, we treat them as complementary components of an “inhabited institutions approach” that focuses on local and extra-local embeddedness, local and extra-local meaning, and a skeptical, inquiring attitude. This approach yields a doubly constructed view: On the one hand, institutions provide the raw materials and guidelines for social interactions (”construct interactions”), and on the other hand, the meanings of institutions are constructed and propelled forward by social interactions. Institutions are not inert categories of meaning; rather they are populated with people whose social interactions suffuse institutions with local force and significance.},

The authors adopt a broad approach to trace the roots and legacies of social psychology with a keen eye to the future. Each chapter provides an in-depth look at a social psychological topic of significance, ranging from self and conflict to families and embodiment. Four theoretical perspectives - cognitive social, discursive psychological, phenomenological and social psychoanalytic - enable students to critically analyse social psychological research. These perspectives are interpreted through the interrogative themes of: Individual-society dualism Agency-structure dualism Situated knowledges Power relations},

 abstract     = {Using a novel form of meta-analysis, this research estimates information processing parameter estimates for older adults using the Card, Moran, & Newell (1983) Model Human Processor model and applies these perceptual, motor, and cognitive parameters to mobile phone usability studies across tasks of increasing complexity. Older adult models predicted older adult human performance data extremely well ( R = 0.99), and older adult models produced equivalent goodness-of-fits to previously validated younger adult models for task completion time, suggesting that older adult parameters are valid for modeling purposes. Critical path analyses for mobile phone tasks supported and substantiated human factors findings and were also decomposed to highlight places where errors would likely occur as a function of cognitive workload, hardware or software design (including menu depth/breadth, button size, environmental supports), and user characteristics. Errors were then classified in ways amenable to modeling and error probabilities were extracted from known human performance. These were implemented in a novel GOMS model for error prediction in a more complex task, and analyses revealed no differences between model predictions and human production of error across all types of classified errors and across young and old age. As such, this research validates older adult parameters so that capabilities and limitations may be better understood with regard to existing designs, and so future technologies may be better designed around the needs of older adults. Further, this research decomposes errors into classifications amenable to human performance modeling, and extends a modeling technique to account for error prediction.},

A case study shows the applicability of the language constructs. Alternative ways for implementing the case study are outlined.

During World War 2, the doctrine of air power became a dominant part of US national defence contributing to the nationalisation of air space. In this paper I raise parallels between the rise of the doctrine of air power in the US during World War 2 and the concerns about national security following the attacks on September 11, 2001. The visual and spatial logics of air power generate a 'cosmic view' that unifies and fixes targets from the air. Yet, this articulation of nationalism is challenged by the current practices and conditions of warfare.},

As such, counterfactual mind-sets were expected to improve performance on tasks involving the consideration of relationships and associations but to impair performance on tasks requiring novel ideas that are uninfluenced by salient associations. The authors conducted several experiments to test this hypothesis. In Experiments 1a and 1b, the authors determined that counterfactual mind-sets increase mental states and preferences for thinking styles consistent with relational thought. Experiment 2 demonstrated a facilitative effect of counterfactual mind-sets on an analytic task involving logical relationships; Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that counterfactual mind-sets structure thought and imagination around salient associations and therefore impaired performance on creative generation tasks. In Experiment 5, the authors demonstrated that the detrimental effect of counterfactual mind-sets is limited to creative tasks involving novel idea generation; in a creative association task involving the consideration of relationships between task stimuli, counterfactual mind-sets improved performance.},

However combining Habermas's vision of discursive politics with Foucault's focus on the micropolitics of resistance provides the basis for developing a more satisfying conception that defines political participation as performance and its purpose as resistance. Such a performative understanding of political participation not only enriches our understanding of discourse and resistance; it also makes better sense of the variety of political activities prevalent and efficacious today.},

We would like to create a database of general- purpose knowledge about actions that encodes com- mon features of many action domains of this kind, in the same way as abstract algebra and topology repre- sent common features of specific number systems. This paper is a report on the first stage of this project-the design of an action description language in which this database will be written. The new language is an ex- tension of the action language C+. Its main distinctive feature is the possibility of referring to other action descriptions in the definition of a new action domain.

 abstract     = {A fully developed nomology for the study of games requires the development of explanatory theoretical constructs associated with validating observational techniques. Drawing from cognition sciences, a framework is proposed based upon the integration of schema theory with attention theory. Cognitive task analysis provides a foundation for preliminary schema descriptions, which can then be elaborated according to more detailed models of cognitive and attentional processes. The resulting theory provides a rich explanatory framework for the cognitive processes underlying game play, as well as detailed hypotheses for the hierarchical structure of pleasures and rewards motivating players. Game engagement is accounted for as a process of schema selection or development, while immersion is explained in terms of schema execution. This framework is being developed not only to explain the substructures of game play, but also to provide schema models that may inform game design processes and provide detailed criteria for the design of patterns of game features for entertainment, pedagogical and therapeutic purposes.},

Traditionally, the vulnerability of coastal communities has been measured either on a micro (community) or a macro (regional) scale. We present research that suggests vulnerability assessments need to be conducted on both micro and a macro scales to more fully address many of the components that contribute to localized community vulnerability. Research presented in this chapter utilizes a GIS methodologically heavy case study of Sarasota County, Florida, in conjunction with an extended version of a vulnerability framework developed by Füssel (2007) to consider traditional components of vulnerability at both the micro and macro scales. This is accomplished through the theoretical concept of geospatially dependent vulnerability where it is demonstrated that local community vulnerability is multi-scalar and thus must be measured at multiple geographic scales to provide a vulnerability analysis sufficiently robust to adequately aid communities in hazard mitigation and resilience enhancement.},

ABMS promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use electronic laborato- ries to do research. Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS is a new way of doing science. Computational advances make possible a growing number of agent-based applications across many fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of bio-warfare, from modeling the growth and decline of ancient civilizations to modeling the complexities of the human immune system, and many more. This tutorial de- scribes the foundations of ABMS, identifies ABMS tool- kits and development methods illustrated through a supply chain example, and provides thoughts on the appropriate contexts for ABMS versus conventional modeling techniques.},

As I write this, the United States is still in denial that its position in the world is rapidly approaching the shrunken irrelevancy of post-imperial Great Britain.

 abstract     = {Contemporary institutional theorizing in the field of organizations dates back thirty-odd years. This particularly describes what are called new or neo-institutionalisms. These terms evoke contrasts with earlier theories of the embeddedness of organizations in social and cultural contexts, now retrospectively called the 'old institutionalism' (Hirsch & Lounsbury, 1997; Stinchcombe, 1997). They went through a period of inattention, so that when institutional thinking came back in force after the 1960s, it seemed quite new. Institutional theories, as they emerged in the 1970s, received much attention in the field, along with other lines of thought emphasizing the dependence of modern organizations on their environments. Perhaps surprisingly, they continue to receive atten- tion, and seem to retain substantial measures of vigor. One secondary aim, here, is to explain why. I primarily review the status and prospects of the principal themes of institutional theory. I concentrate on sociological institutionalism, as capturing core ideas in their most dramatic form, rather than the limited arguments emphasized in economics or political science. And within sociological versions, I concen- trate on phenomenological theories. These reflect my own interests, are continuing loci of research creativity, and contrast most sharply with other lines of social scientific theorizing about organizations. In practice, 'organizations' tends to be both a research field, and a realist ideology about modern society: phenomenological thinking steps back from that commitment, and is useful in analyzing, for example, why so much formal organization exists in the modern world (Drori, Meyer,    Hwang, 2006).},

This special issue includes two conceptual articles on the qualities of indigenous healing among rural elderly African Americans and Native Americans in the United States. It also presents three empirical studies in the qualitative tradition on help seeking for people with psychiatric illness in Pakistan, and South Africa, and the diagnosis, aetiology, and treatments for psychiatric illness in Mexico and South Africa. Also provided are two invited reaction articles giving insightful observations on the core issues and implications of the five contributed articles.

 abstract     = {Many information extraction (IE) systems rely on manually annotated training data to learn patterns or rules for extracting information about events. Manually annotating data is expensive, however, and a new data set must be annotated for each domain. So most IE training sets are relatively small. Consequently, IE patterns learned from annotated training sets often have limited coverage. In this paper, we explore the idea of using the Web to automatically identify domain-specific IE patterns that were not seen in the training data. We use IE patterns learned from the MUC-4 training set as anchors to identify domain-specific web pages and then learn new IE patterns from them. We compute the semantic affinity of each new pattern to automatically infer the type of information that it will extract. Experiments on the MUC-4 test set show that these new IE patterns improved recall with only a small precision loss.},

 abstract     = {Interactive Narrative is an approach to interactive entertainment that enables the player to make decisions that directly affect the direction and/or outcome of the narrative experience being delivered by the computer system. Interactive narrative requires two seemingly conflicting requirements: coherent narrative and user agency. We present an interactive narrative system that uses a combination of narrative control and autonomous believable character agents to augment a story world simulation in which the user has a high degree of agency with narrative plot control. A drama manager called the Automated Story Director gives plot-based guidance to believable agents. The believable agents are endowed with the autonomy necessary to carry out directives in the most believable fashion possible. Agents also handle interaction with the user. When the user performs actions that change the world in such a way that the Automated Story Director can no longer drive the intended narrative forward, it is able to adapt the plot to incorporate the user's changes and still achieve dramatic goals.},

The purpose of most story authoring is not to invent a new style or genre of story that will be accepted by the population but to invent a single narrative that is novel enough to be tellable. Computational story generation systems are more limited in the space of narratives than human authors because it is often the case that a story generation system is constrained to operate within a fixed representation of the sotry world. These limitatinos can impact whether a story generation system is considered creative or not. In this paper, we describe a story planning system, Fabulist. Fabulist however is constrained by the world model input by the system user. We present two algorithms that enable story planning system such as Fabulist to break outside the bounds of the initial world model in order to search a larger space of narratives.},

Moving from the concepts of role (with its normative consequences, i.e. obligations, permissions and prohibitions), norms (both regulative and constitutive), and normative agents, we first introduce the notion of computational institution for modelling norm-regulated MAS. Then, we discuss how infrastructural abstractions like coordination artifacts can be exploited to express norms inside computational institutions. Finally, we present an example based on the TuCSoN infrastructure.},

The focus of this chapter is overwhelmingly on the third heading, that of tools. These in turn divide, roughly, into tools for analyzing data, tools for constructing and evaluating models, and tools for measuring complexity. I discuss the principles of statistical learning and model selection; time series analysis; cellular automata; agent-based models; the evaluation of complex-systems models; information theory; and ways of measuring complexity. Throughout, I give only rough outlines of techniques, so that readers, confronted with new problems, will have a sense of which ones might be suitable, and which ones definitely are not.},

 abstract     = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the transdisciplinary case study (TCS) as a learning framework based on what we call functional socio-cultural constructivism and project-based learning (PBL). In doing so, the paper attempts to illustrate the applicability of TCS to learn competencies and skills necessary to research problems of sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach - TCS is considered a learning framework based on the principle of self-regulated learning; i.e. students must actively deal with the requirements as well as plan and execute their project work within their own worldviews and goals. TCS methods are essential as we tackle complex real-world problems. Findings - The paper discusses challenges and obstacles of such an approach and present lessons learned since 1994, on both the viewpoints of students and of teachers. It conclude that case study learning is a demanding task, especially in a transdisciplinary context where more challenges emerge than in PBL, since goals of teachers, case agents, and students have to be balanced. Practical implications - TCS or courses like it are important for universities at the present time. Under present budget restrictions and a wide-ranging mistrust of society toward universities, there is a necessity for a new contract between society and research: students should learn to take over responsibility in societal contexts and be able to communicate beyond the “ivory tower”. Originality/value - The learning goals of TCS differ from the goals of most university courses. They are more comprehensive and include complex problem solving, societal context, and group processes. The ambitious goal is that students become enabled to tackle complex, real-world problems.},

 abstract     = {Player enjoyment is the single-most important goal of games. Games that are not enjoyable are not bought or played. Within games, enjoyment of the gameplay hinges on the game world. However, game worlds are often static and highly scripted, which leads to restricted and shallow gameplay that can detract from player enjoyment. It is possible that player enjoyment could be improved by the creation of more flexible game worlds that give players more freedom and control. One way to create more flexible game worlds is through the use of an emergent approach to designing game worlds. This thesis investigates an emergent approach to designing game worlds, as well as the issues, considerations, and implications for game players and developers. The research reported in this thesis consisted of three parts. The first part involved conducting a focus group and questionnaire with players to address the research question: what issues exist for players interacting in game worlds and how do these issues correspond with those identified by game developers? The second part of the research, in which the Emergent Games Engine Technology (EmerGEnT) system was developed, involved investigating how game worlds can be made more open and emergent. The applicability of cellular automata to games was investigated, as was the extent to which they can facilitate emergent behaviour and gameplay. The test-bed for the EmerGEnT system was a strategy game world that was developed using a 3D games engine, the Auran Jet. The EmerGEnT system consists of three main parts: the environment, objects, and agents. The third part of the research involved evaluating the EmerGEnT system against a set of criteria for player enjoyment in games, which allowed the system's role in facilitating player enjoyment to be defined. The third part of the thesis investigated the extent to which the EmerGEnT system can facilitate player enjoyment in comparison to conventional scripted system and the ways in which the EmerGEnT system can facilitate player enjoyment. v In the player-centred studies, it was found that players are dissatisfied with the static, inconsistent and unrealistic elements of current games and that they desire more interactivity, realism and control. The development and testing of the EmerGEnT system showed that an emergent game world design, based on cellular automata, can facilitate emergent behaviour in a limited domain. The domain modelled by the EmerGEnT system was heat, fire, rain, fluid flow, pressure, and explosions in a strategy game world. The EmerGEnT system displayed advantages relating to its ability to dynamically determine and accommodate the specific state of the game world due to the underlying properties of the cells, objects, and agents. It also provided a model for emergent game worlds, which allowed more complexity than emergent objects alone. Finally, the evaluation of enjoyment revealed that incorporating an emergent game world (such as the EmerGEnT system) into a game could improve player enjoyment in terms of concentration, challenge, player skills, control, and feedback by allowing more intuitive, consistent, and emergent interactions with the game world. The implications of this research are that cellular automata can facilitate emergence in games, at least in a limited domain. Furthermore, emergence in games has the potential to enhance player enjoyment in areas where current game worlds are weak. Finally, the EmerGEnT system serves as a proof of concept of using emergence in games, provides a model for simulating environmental systems in games and was used to identify core issues and considerations for future development and research of emergent game worlds.},

We develop a framework that articulates what change awareness information is critical if people are to track and maintain change awareness. Information elements include: knowing who changed the artifact, what those changes involve, where changes occur, when changes were made, how things have changed and why people made the changes. The framework accounts for people's need to view these changes from different perspectives: an artifact-based view, a person-based view and a workspace-based view. Each information element is further broken down into distinguishing features and matched against these perspectives, e.g., location history within the where category prompts the questions 'where was this artifact when I left' in the artifact-based view, 'where in the workspace has a person visited' in the person-based view and 'where have people been in the workspace' in the workspace-based view. The framework can be used both to inform and critique change awareness tools. ©2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The notion of constitutive rules have been proposed to describe the conceptual nature of institutions. In this paper it is extended to cover specific processes of 'recognition' that provide the agents with additional artificial powers. The power of doing an institutional action is considered as a special kind of artificial power. It is argued that institutional actions achieve their effects thanks to a cognitive and behavioral mediation of a collective of agents. Individual actions are seen and treated as (count as) institutional actions by the involved participants even if, in fact, institutional actions are collective actions. When human behavior becomes institutionalized, it acquires special conventional powers to bring about effects in the social world. A model of such conventional empowerment of an agent is proposed and is identified in a sort of collective permission. Finally it is argued that institutions are a specific kind of coordination artifacts. In particular, the importance of institutional roles as artifacts that assign conventional powers is investigated. ©2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Particularly in stressful situations such as combat, it is at least as important as rational analysis in determining a participants behavior. DETT (Disposition, Emotion, Trigger, Tendency) is an environmentally mediated model of emotion that captures the essential features of the widely-used OCC (Ortony, Clore, Collins) model in a computationally tractable framework that can support large numbers of combatants. We motivate and describe this architecture, and report preliminary experiments that use it in simulating combat scenarios.},

 abstract     = {Most studies of digital media focus on elements familiar from traditional media. For example, studies of digital literature generally focus on surface text and audience experience. Interaction is considered only from the audience's perspective. This study argues that such approaches fail to interpret the element that defines digital media-computational processes. An alternative is proposed here, focused on interpreting the internal operations of works. It is hoped that this will become a complement to (rather than replacement for) previous approaches. The examples considered include both processes developed as general practices and those of specific works. A detailed survey of story generation begins with James Meehan's Tale-Spin, interpreted through “possible worlds” theories of fiction (especially as employed by digital media theorists such as Marie-Laure Ryan). Previous interpretations missed important elements of Tale-Spin 's fiction that are not visible in its output. Other story generation systems discussed include Minstrel, Universe, Brutus, and Terminal Time. These reveal the inevitably authored nature of simulations of human behavior. Further, the persistently anthropomorphizing approach to computational processes present in traditional artificial intelligence (and many critiques) is contrasted with authorship. Also discussed is Christopher Strachey's love letter generator for the Manchester Mark I—likely the first work of digital literature, and arguably the first digital art of any kind. As with Tale-Spin, an interpretation of its processes offers more than output-focused approaches. In addition, this study considers works with algorithmic processes carried out by authors and audiences (rather than within the works) created by Raymond Queneau, Tristan Tzara, and Claude Shannon. Prior theoretical concepts are engaged, including Espen Aarseth's “cybertext,” Michael Mateas's ”expressive AI,” and Chris Crawford's ”process intensity.” A set of concepts and vocabulary are proposed, beginning with the simple distinction between ”surface,” ”data,” and ”process.” Further chapters introduce the terms ”implemented processes,” ”abstract processes,” and ”works of process.” The most unfamiliar new term, ”operational logics,” names behavioral elements of systems that can be as elemental as gravity or as high-level as a quest structure. The computer game Fable embodies the strengths and weaknesses of using the same logics to drive graphical and linguistic behavior.},

At mid-depth in the mixed layer, the downwelling flow had magnitudes of up to 0.2 meter per second and was accompanied by a downwind, horizontal jet of comparable magnitude. There is some evidence that these motions transport heat and phytoplankton within the mixed layer.},
