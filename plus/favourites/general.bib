You might play games like 'Alcoholic' or 'The Frigid Woman' at weekends, or perhaps 'Ain't it awful' or 'Kick me' while you're at work. First published in the 1960s and recognized as a classic work of its kind by professionals, the bestselling {\textquotedblleft}Games People Play{\textquotedblright} is also an accessible and fascinating read. It is a wise, original, witty and very sensible analysis of the games we play in order to live with one another - and with ourselves.},

 abstract     = {There is a population explosion among the logical systems being used in computer science. Examples include first order logic (with and without equality), equational logic, Horn clause logic, second order logic, higher order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic, process logic, temporal logic, and modal logic; moreover, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic logical system. Yet it is usual to give many of the same results and applications for each logical system; of course, this is natural in so far as there are basic results in computer science that are independent of the logical system in which they happen to be expressed. But we should not have to do the same things over and over again; instead, we should generalize, and do the essential things once and for all! Also, we should ask what are the relationships among all these different logical systems. This paper shows how some parts of computer science can be done in any suitable logical system, by introducing the notion of an institution as a precise generalization of the informal notion of a {\textquotedblleft}logical system.{\textquotedblright} A first main result shows that if an institution is such that interface declarations expressed in it can be glued together, then theories (which are just sets of sentences) in that institution can also be glued together. A second main result gives conditions under which a theorem prover for one institution can be validly used on theories from another; this uses the notion of an institution morphism. A third main result shows that institutions admiting free models can be extended to institutions whose theories may include, in addition to the original sentences, various kinds of constraints upon interpretations; such constraints are useful for defining abstract data types, and include so-called \{ extquotedblleft\}data,\{ extquotedblright\} \{ extquotedblright\}hierarchy,\{ extquotedblright\} and \{ extquotedblright\}generating\{ extquotedblright\} constraints. Further results show how to define insitutions that mix sentences from one institution with constraints from another, and even mix sentences and (various kinds of) constraints from several different institutions. It is noted that general results about institutions apply to such \{ extquotedblright\}multiplex\{ extquotedblright\} institutions, including the result mentioned above about gluing together theories. Finally, this paper discusses some applications of these results to specification languages, showing that much of that subject is in fact independent of the institution used.},

Examples include first-order logic, equational logic, Horn-clause logic, higher-order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic. intuitionistic logic, order-sorted logic, and temporal loglc; moreover, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic loglcal system. The concept of institution is introduced to formalize the informal notion of logical system. The major requirement is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences that is consistent under change of notation. Institutions enable abstracting away from syntactic and semantic detail when working on language structure in-the-large; for example, we can define language features for building large structures from smaller ones, possibly involving parameters, without commitment to any particular logical system, This applies to both specification languages and programming languages. Institutions also have applications to such areas as database theory and the semantics of artnlcial and natural languages. A first main result of this paper says that any institution such that signatures (which define notation) can be glued together, also allows gluing together theories (which are just collections of sentences over a fixed signature). A second main result considers when theory structuring is preserved by institution morphisms. A third mam result gwes conditions under which lt M sound to use a theorem prover for one institution on theories from another. A fourth main result shows bow to extend institutions so that their theories may include, in addltlon to the original sentences, various kinds of constraint that are useful for defining abstract data types, including both data and hierarchy constraints. Further results show how to define institutions that allow sentences and constraints from two or more institutions. All our general results apply to such constraints and multiplex institutions.},

The rules, norms, and shared strategies are constituted and reconstituted by human interaction in frequently occurring or repetitive situations. The syntax of the grammar identifies components of institutions and sorts them into three types of institutional statements: rules, norms, and shared strategies. We introduce the grammar, outline methods for operationalizing the syntax, apply the syntax to an analysis of cooperation in collective dilemma situations, and discuss the pragmatics of the grammar for analyses of behavior within complex institutional settings.},

Through close attention to the metaphors of AI and their consequences for the field's patterns of success and failure, it argues for a reorientation of the field away from thought in the head and toward activity in the world. By considering computational ideas in a philosophical framework, the author eases critical dialogue between technology and the humanities and social sciences. AI can benefit from new understandings of human nature, and in return, it offers a powerful mode of investigation into the practicalities and consequences of physical realization.},

 abstract     = {In this paper a theory of delegation is presented. There are at least three reasons for developing such a theory. First, one of the most relevant notions of {\textquotedblleft}agent{\textquotedblright} is based on the notion of {\textquotedblright}task{\textquotedblright} and of {\textquotedblright}on behalf of{\textquotedblright}. In order to found this notion a theory of delegation among agents is needed. Second, the notion of autonomy should be based on different kinds and levels of delegation. Third, the entire theory of cooperation and collaboration requires the definition of the two complementary attitudes of goal delegation and adoption linking collaborating agents. After motivating the necessity for a principled theory of delegation (and adoption) the paper presents a plan-based approach to this theory. We analyze several dimensions of the delegation/adoption (on the basis of the interaction between the agents, of the specification of the task, of the possibility to subdelegate, of the delegation of the control, of the help levels). The agent's autonomy and levels of agency are then deduced. We describe the modelling of the client from the contractor's point of view and vice versa, with their differences, and the notion of trust that directly derives from this modelling. Finally, a series of possible conflicts between client and contractor are considered: in particular collaborative conflicts, which stem from the contractor's intention to help the client beyond its request or delegation and to exploit its own knowledge and intelligence (reasoning, problem solving, planning, and decision skills) for the client itself.},

 abstract     = {In the new AI of the 90s an important stream is artificial social intelligence. In this work basic ontological categories for social action, structure, and mind are introduced. Sociality (social action, social structure) is let emerge from the action and intelligence of individual agents in a common world. Also some aspects of the way-down-how emergent collective phenomena shape the individual mind-are examined. First, interference and dependence are defined, and then different kinds of coordination (reactive versus anticipatory; unilateral versus bilateral; selfish versus collaborative) are characterised. {\textquotedblleft}Weak social action{\textquotedblright}, based on beliefs about the mind of the other agents, and {\textquotedblright}strong social action{\textquotedblright}, based on goals about others' minds and their actions, are distinguished. Special attention is paid to Goal Delegation and Goal Adoption that are considered as the basic ingredients of social commitment and contract, and then of exchange, cooperation, group action, and organisation. Different levels of delegation and then of autonomy of the delegated agent are described; and different levels of goal-adoption are shown to characterise true collaboration. Social goals in the minds of the group members are argued to be the real glue of joint activity, and the notion of social commitment, as different from individual and from collective commitment, is underlined. The necessity for modelling social objective structures and constraints is emphasised and the {\textquotedblright}shared mind{\textquotedblright} view of groups and organisations is criticised. The spontaneous and unaware emergence of a dependence structure is explained, as well as its feedback on the participants' minds and behaviours. Critical observations are presented on current confusions such as that between {\textquotedblright}social{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblright}collective{\textquotedblright} action, or between communication and social action. The main claims of the paper are the following: (a) The real foundation of all sociality (cooperation, competition, groups, organisation, etc.) is the individual social action and mind. One cannot reduce or connect action at the collective level to action at the individual level unless one passes through the social character of the individual action, (b) Important levels of coordination and cooperation necessarily require minds and cognitive agents (beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.). (c) However, cognition, communication and agreement are not enough for modelling and implementing cooperation: emergent pre-cognitive structures and constraints should be formalised, and emergent forms of cooperation are needed also among planning and deliberative agents, (d) We are going towards a synthetic paradigm in AI and Cognitive Science, reconciling situatedness and plans, reactivity and mental representations, cognition, emergence and self-organisation.},

Variously adapted, they are handed down: in the process, they acquire almost doctrinal unassailability. One such parable, which has been retold in technology and urban studies for a long time, is the story of Robert Moses' low bridges, preventing the poor and the black of New York from gaining access to Long Island resorts and beaches. The story turns out to be counterfactual, but even if a small myth is disenchanted, it serves a purpose: to resituate positions in the old debate about the control of social processes via buildings and other technical artefacts - or, more generally, about material form and social content.},

 abstract     = {We present a formal model of argumentation based on situation calculus which captures both the logical and the procedural aspects of argumentation processes. The logic is used to determine what is accepted by each agent participating in the discussion and by the group as a whole, on the basis of the speech acts performed during argumentation. Argumentation protocols, also called rules of order, describe declaratively which speech acts are legal in a particular state of the argumentation. We first discuss argumentation with fixed rules of order. Our model tolerates protocol violations but makes it possible to object to illegal actions. In realistic settings the rules of order themselves can at any time become the topic of the debate. We show how meta-level argumentation of this kind can be modelled in what we call dynamic argument systems. To illustrate the notions introduced in the paper we present a reconstruction of Rescher's theory of formal disputation and a dynamic argument system with three levels which we use to discuss a murder case.},

 abstract     = {Organisations can be defined as a set of entities regulated by mechanisms of social order and created by more or less autonomous actors to achieve common goals. Multi-agent systems are a natural choice to design organisational systems due to the proactive and autonomous behaviour of agents. However, in business environments it is necessary to consider the behaviour of the global system and the collective aspects of the domain. In this paper, we argue that multi-agent systems should be designed around organisational co-ordination frameworks that reflect the co-ordination structures of the particular organisation. As in human societies, we argue that norms and institutions are a way for agent societies to cope with the challenge of social order. Through institutions, conventions and interaction patterns for the co-ordination of agents can be specified, monitored and managed.},

Two themes run throughout the book: temporal flow and sexual specificity. Grosz argues that time, change, and emergence, traditionally viewed as outside the concerns of space, must become more integral to the processes of design and construction. She also argues against architectures historical indifference to sexual specificity, asking what the existence of (at least) two sexes has to do with how we understand and experience space. Drawing on the work of such philosophers as Henri Bergson, Roger Caillois, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Luce Irigaray, and Jacques Lacan, Grosz raises abstract but nonformalistic questions about space, inhabitation, and building. All of the essays propose philosophical experiments to render space and building more mobile and dynamic.},

 abstract     = {E-markets and negotiation protocols are two types of application domains that can be viewed as open computational societies. Key characteristics of such societies are agent heterogeneity, conflicting individual goals and limited trust. The risk that members of such societies will not conform to specifications imposes the need for a framework that will facilitate the designers to determine to what extent it is desirable to deploy their agents in such societies. We address this need by presenting a formal framework for specifying, animating, and ultimately reasoning about and verifying the properties of open computational systems. We view computational systems from an external perspective, aiming to account for the institutional and social aspects of these systems. We identify the key concepts and illustrate how they are used by formalising an example employing the contract net protocol. The framework and associated logical inferences have been implemented as a software platform that provides automated animation of the global states of an open system (society) during its execution. Simulations have demonstrated that the implementation of the framework establishes a foundation for a rich, formal representation of open computational societies.},

We viewed computational systems from an external perspective, with a focus on the institutional and the social aspects of these systems. The social constraints and roles of the open societies were specified with the use of the Event Calculus. In this paper, we formalise our frame- work with the use of the C+ language, a formalism with explicit state transition semantics. We use the implementation of the C+ language, the Causal Calculator, a software tool for representing commonsense knowledge about action and change, to animate and validate the spec- ifications of computational societies. We demonstrate the utility of the Causal Calculator (by specifying and executing a Contract-Net Pro- tocol) and comment on its functionality regarding the specification of computational societies.},

We also discuss the constraining effect of autonomy on the recursive nest-ing of multiagent organisation. As the domain for applying multiagent systems we choose a general view on multiagent task-assignment.},

Its rigorous approach uses category theory to achieve independence from any particular choice of representation, and institutions to achieve independence from any particular choice of logic. Corelations and colimits provide a general formalization of information integration, and Grothendieck constructions extend this to several kinds of heterogeneity.

We have designed and implemented JavaCOP, a program constraint system for implementing practical pluggable type systems for Java.

By using a program constraint system to implement pluggable types, programmers are able to check that their programs will operate correctly in restricted environments, adhere to strict programming rules, avoid null pointer errors or scoped memory exceptions, and meet style guidelines, while programming language researchers can easily experiment with novel type systems.},

It enables users to build complex multi-agent systems that are capable of operating in environments previously considered too unpredictable for computers to handle. Jason is easily customisable and is suitable for the implementation of reactive planning systems according to the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture. Programming Multi-Agent Systems in AgentSpeak using Jason provides a brief introduction to multi-agent systems and the BDI agent architecture on which AgentSpeak is based. The authors explain Jason's AgentSpeak variant and provide a comprehensive, practical guide to using Jason to program multi-agent systems. Some of the examples include diagrams generated using an agent-oriented software engineering methodology particularly suited for implementation using BDI-based programming languages. The authors also give guidance on good programming style with AgentSpeak Programming Multi-Agent Systems in AgentSpeak using Jason. Describes and explains in detail the AgentSpeak extension interpreted by Jason and shows how to create multi-agent systems using the Jason platform. Reinforces learning with examples, problems, and illustrations. Includes two case studies which demonstrate the use of Jason in practice},

Designers are faced with two concurrent, difficult tasks: firstly specifying the relationships (over time) of agents' actions and their effects, and secondly combining this model with another that captures the agents' permissions and obligations. In this paper we present our model and operational semantics for specifying individual and collective institutions and outline a declarative action language for describing them. We demonstrate, by way of an example, how this may be used to enable the analysis of institutional specifications either for simply visualising possible outcomes or for checking for absence or presence of certain (un)desirable correctness properties.},

The last years have witnessed the attempt by physicists to study collective phenomena emerging from the interactions of individuals as elementary units in social structures. Here we review the state of the art by focusing on a wide list of topics ranging from opinion, cultural and language dynamics to crowd behavior, hierarchy formation, human dynamics, social spreading. We highlight the connections between these problems and other, more traditional, topics of statistical physics. We also emphasize the comparison of model results with},

Key characteristics of such societies are agent heterogeneity, conflicting individual goals and unpredictable behavior. Members of such societies may fail to, or even choose not to, conform to the norms governing their interactions. It has been argued that systems of this type should have a formal, declarative, verifiable, and meaningful semantics. We present a theoretical and computational framework being developed for the executable specification of open agent societies. We adopt an external perspective and view societies as instances of normative systems. In this article, we demonstrate how the frame- work can be applied to specifying and executing a contract-net protocol. The specification is formalized in two action languages, the C+ language and the Event Calculus, and executed using respective software implementations, the Causal Calculator and the Society Visualizer. We evaluate our executable specification in the light of the presented case study, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the employed action languages for the specification of open agent societies.},

 abstract     = {Multi-agent systems where the members are developed by parties with competing interests, and where there is no access to a member's internal state, are often classified as 'open'. The specification of protocols for open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a design-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification modification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is often required to revise the specification during the protocol execution. To address this requirement, we present an infrastructure for 'dynamic' protocol specifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at runtime by agents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a modification of the 'rules of the game' as well as decision-making over and enactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule modification by modelling dynamic specifications as metric spaces. Furthermore, we constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation criteria. We illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a resourcesharing protocol, and an execution of this protocol in which the participating agents modify the protocol specification.},

 abstract     = {How Canadians Communicate: Contexts of Popular Culture is the third in a series of books meant both to chronicle and to contribute to our understanding of the Canadian experience. The first volume focused on the challenges that Canadian media and communication industries faced as they entered the first years of the twenty-first century. The second volume dealt with the impact of globalization on Canadian media and culture and how Canadians both adapt to and resist these influences. This third volume describes not only the sites of popular culture-social media, video games, art, mem- ory institutions, cinema, sports, and so on-but the seeds and sparks that create these explosions of expression and creativity. But these experiences intersect with gender, social class, language, region, ethnic heritage, and age, among other factors and conditions to determine how we use and give meaning to pop- ular culture. The book raises critical issues about our uses of myths and stereo- types, how we define beauty, how we deal with our darkest visions, the role of violence in society, how culture is used both to enforce and to push the bound- aries of convention and social control and how we express our many identities. The hope is that Contexts of Popular Culture will both illuminate this complex and multi-textured landscape, and become a catalyst for research and discussion.},

However, system developers face significant challenges in identifying and managing the many laws that govern their services and products. To address this challenge, we investigate a method to codify, analyze, and trace relationships among requirements from different regulations that share a common theme of data breach notification. To measure gaps and overlaps between regulations, we applied previously validated requirements metrics. Our findings include a formalization of the legal landscape using operational constructs for high- and low-watermark practices, which business analysts and system developers can use to reason about compliance trade-offs based on perceived businesses costs and risks. We discovered and validated these constructs using five U.S. state data breach notification laws that govern transactions of financial and health information of state residents.},

 abstract     = {How are tasks bundled into and across jobs within organizations? In this paper, I develop a model of this process of job design by drawing on a multisite qualitative study of task allocation following the installation of a DNA sequencer. The model that emerges is one of the assembly of tasks through multiple subassembly processes with multiple assemblers. Four activities produced requirements and requests for job designs and propositions about how to meet these: actively searching, passively receiving, doing work, and invoking preexisting ideas. The ideas that emerge from these processes are further transformed through reconciliation, interpretation, and performance. My observations show that this overall process is far reaching and incorporates many elements, not all of which are explicitly intended for job designs. The arrangements that emerge from this process are not the product of a deliberate and controlled job design process within the boundaries of a single organization},

We present a method for supporting this design process, placing emphasis on different levels of formal characterization, with equal attention to both the analysis of concepts in a formal calculus independent of computational concerns, and the representation of concepts in a machine-processable form, fully cognizant of implementation issues-a step in the method we refer to as principled operationalization. There are many tools (i.e. formal languages) that can be used to support the design method; we define and discuss criteria for evaluating such tools. We believe that, were the method proposed to be adopted, it would enhance the state-of-the-art in the systematic design and engineering of socio-technical systems, respecting the fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of those tasks, in both their theoretical and practical dimensions.},

In particular, I will argue that these artifacts specify (predict and prescribe) the mental contents of the participants, both in terms of beliefs and acceptances and in terms of motives and plans. We have to revise the behavioristic view of {\textquotedblleft}scripts{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblright}roles{\textquotedblright}; when we play a role we wear a {\textquotedblright}mind.{\textquotedblright} No collective action would be possible without shared and/or ascribed mental contents. This is also very crucial for a central form of automatic mind-reading (mind ascription). Second, I will argue that often what really matters is the ascribed/prescribed, worn, mind not the real, private one. We have to play (like in the symbolic play) {\textquotedblright}as if{\textquotedblright} we had those mental contents. This social convention and mutual assumption makes the interaction work. The ascribed beliefs and goals are not necessarily explicitly there; they might be just implicit as inactive (we act just by routine and automatically) or implicit as potential. The coordination and social action works thanks to these {\textquotedblright}as if{\textquotedblright} (ascribed and pretended) minds, thanks to those conventional constructs. Our social minds for social interactions are coordination artifacts and social institutions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

 abstract     = {This article examines the informational exchanges between consumers, food activists and small-scale food producers and vendors through the lenses of justice and literacy. Employing participant observations and interviews at food-related events in South Florida, the article offers two contributions to the growing research on food systems: (1) small-scale food producers, farmworkers, vendors and activists are working an additional shift as citizen educators; and (2) farmworker justice and climate change remain neglected and disconnected from food-related concerns. This article argues that consumers, producers and vendors share an interest and a passion for good-tasting, healthy food that starts a conversation. Yet together they minimize or avoid the politicized nature of climate change and the moral problem of farmworker exploitation. Furthermore, the scientifically complex subject of genetic engineering emerged as a concern and point of activism during the course of this research. Together, climate change, labor and genetic engineering remain difficult topics to bring into conversations and into the food community's educational efforts due to the political, moral and scientifically challenging nature of each concern respectively. This work suggests that citizens as consumers would be empowered by a more complete understanding of the food system, including (1) molecular-level changes due to biotechnology; (2) workplace injustices in the fields; and (3) the links between agriculture and climate change-what this article refers to as food system literacy. The absence of food system literacy is a social problem that masks structural inequities and long-term risks, and that discourages or disables identification and discussion of some of the more complicated issues related to the food chain.},

Just like agents, organizations should also be able to adapt themselves to changing environments. In order to develop a theory of how this reorganization should be performed we need a formal framework in which organizations, organizational performance and the reorganization itself can be described. In this article, we present a formal description of reorganization actions in Logic forAgent Organization. We show how this formalization can support the preservation of some nice properties of organizations while it can also be used to reason about which reorganization is needed to achieve some basic organizational properties.

Ceptre can be viewed as an explication of a new methodology for understanding games based on linear logic, a formal logic concerned with resource usage.We present a correspondence between gameplay and proof search in linear logic, building on prior work on gen- erating narratives. In Ceptre, we introduce the ability to add interactivity selectively into a generative model, en- abling inspection of intermediate states for debugging and exploration as well as a means of play. We claim that this methodology can support game de- signers and researchers in designing, anaylzing, and de- bugging the core systems of their work in generative, multi-agent gameplay. To support this claim, we pro- vide two case studies implemented in Ceptre, one from interactive narrative and one from a strategy-like do- main. Introduction},

 abstract     = {From computer games to human societies, many natural and artificial phenomena can be represented as multi-agent systems. Over time, these systems have been proven a really powerful tool for modelling and understanding phenomena in fields, such as economics and trading, health care, urban planning and social sciences. However, although, intelligent agents have been around for years, their actual implementation is still in its early stages. Since the late nineties many agent platforms have been developed. Some of them have already been abandoned whereas others continue releasing new versions. On the other hand, the agent-oriented research community is still providing more and more new platforms. This vast amount of platform options leads to a high degree of heterogeneity. Hence, a common problem is how people interested in using multi-agent systems should choose which platform to use in order to benefit from agent technology. This decision was usually left to word of mouth, past experiences or platform publicity, lately however people depend on solid survey articles. To date, in most cases multi-agent system surveys describe only the basic characteristics of a few representatives without even providing any classification of the systems themselves. This article presents a comparative up-to-date review of the most promising existing agent platforms that can be used. It is based on universal comparison and evaluation criteria, proposing classifications for helping readers to understand which agent platforms broadly exhibit similar properties and in which situations which choices should be made.},

The automatic anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies assay offered great advantages over traditional methods in terms of improved precision, reliability, technical simplicity, short turnaround time and high-speed throughput. In this study, we evaluated the main technical performance and diagnostic accuracy of the first automatic anti-CCP assay approved in China. Methods. The study comprised 106 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, 203 non-RA rheumatic disease controls and 46 healthy persons. Anti-CCP, rheumatoid factor (RF), 1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were measured and compared. The precision, reference intervals for Chinese population and cut-off value for RA diagnosis, as well as the suitable diluent for anti-CCP were assessed. The positive rate and score of anti-CCP were compared with RF and acute-phase reactants, according to the new RA criteria. Results. Within- and between-run imprecision, expressed as the coefficient of variation, were 0.47-1.36},

While rules certainly channel and constrain behavior, and in principle require some actions and prohibit others, deviations from these requirements and prohibitions do occur. In addition, rules may be {\textquotedblright} interpreted, {\textquotedblright} and the rules, themselves, do change - what humans devise they may revise. With all this conceptual movement, are the rules of the game too wobbly a foundation for the study of institutions? Note to Ostrom Workshop Colloquium Series readers: This is, indeed, a {\textquotedblright} work in progress, {\textquotedblright} inasmuch as potential blind alleys and false starts, as well as only the earliest version of a potential way forward, are in evidence in the present draft. The topic, moreover, is somewhat more abstract and foundational than is your normal fare. While I would welcome technical reactions and constructive advice, I am especially interested in the practical matter about how to wrap one's mind around {\textquotedblright} the rules of the game. {\textquotedblright}},

Applications in such domains often depend on reflection over knowledge, including what an agent knows about what other agents know. We are interested in enabling formal specification of these systems which may be used for executable prototyping as well as verification and other formal reasoning. Dynamic Epistemic Logic provides a formal basis for such reasoning, but is often prohibitively cumbersome to use in practice. We present an implementation and macro system called Ostari, backed by a particular flavor of Dynamic Epistemic Logic, which allows us to scale the ideas to more realistic problems. We demonstrate how actions that manipulate agents' beliefs can be written concisely and how this capability can be applied to modeling a popular card game by utilizing our system's ability to execute action sequences, answer queries about knowledge states, and find action sequences to satisfy a particular goal.},

 abstract     = {The article is concerned with the latest developments in Indonesia's Islamic field. Its focus is on the role of social media in exchange relationships between Islamic preachers and their constituency. The article first discusses economic exchanges between preachers and their followers, and then it concentrates on social exchanges and how they are mediated today. Empirically, the article delivers insight into the concerns of mostly female Indonesian middle-class Muslims and shows how preachers have to adjust to the needs of their followers who are regularly online. Theoretically, the article offers a rereading of Pierre Bourdieu's classic work on forms of capital and their conversion. It emphasizes the temporal dimension of capital accumulation and conversion and explores the temporalities of online exchanges that have become constitutive of preacher-follower relationships. In doing so, it shows how Indonesia's Islamic preacher economy is currently transformed by these online exchanges, resulting in preacher-follower relationships that are characterized by dialogic constructions of Islamic authority. Being part of Indonesia's Islamic field, these changes in the Islamic preacher economy point to a broader trend in Indonesia's Islamic field toward greater sensitivity to the needs and worries of Indonesian middle-class Muslims.},

An organisation's modus operandi is enacting and fulfilling contracts between itself and its participants. Yet, organisational contracts should respect external laws, such as those setting out data privacy rights and liberties. Contracts can only be enacted by following contract law processes, which often require bilateral agreement and consideration. Governments need to legislate whilst understanding today's context of national and international governance hierarchy where law makers shun isolationism and seek to influence one another. Governments should avoid punishment by respecting constraints from international treaties and human rights charters. Governments can only enact legislation by following their own, pre-existing, law making procedures. In other words, institutions, such as laws and contracts are designed and enacted under constraints.},

 abstract     = {Current urban developments are often considered outdated and static, and the argument follows that they should become more adaptive. In this paper, we argue that existing urban development are already adaptive and incremental. Given this flexibility in urban development, understanding changes in the so-called 'rules of the game' which structure and change collective action, is increasingly relevant. Gaining such insights advances the ability of planners to deal with perceived spatial problems. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, to develop an analytical framework for scrutinizing changes in rules in incremental urban developments and second, to test the analytical framework in a real-life incremental urban development. Building on Ostrom's IAD Framework we develop an analytical framework that makes a distinction between formal and informal rules, connects sets of rules, actors and interaction patterns and provides a comparative, longitudinal perspective. The case of the Navy Yard in Amsterdam, the Netherlands is used in order to test the framework's application, proving the relevance of investigating how rules in urban development change.},

Agent's choices are based on a logit function and gradual decay of memories of past profits. Numerical simulations demonstrate the stability of various dynamical regimes, such as disorder, fairness or inequity, according to parameters and initial conditions. When playing the game on a lattice i.e. using neighbouring agent interactions instead of random interaction among the whole agent population, one observes spatial domains and specific patterns in addition to the temporal convergence toward attractors observed when interactions involve any pair of agents. A result specific to the network topology is the co-existence of domains with different regimes, allowing the emergence of the inequity condition even in the absence of tags.},

 abstract     = {There are multiple theories regarding how institutions change over time, but institutional change is often difficult to study and understand in practice. Agent-based modeling is known as a technique to explore emergent phenomena resulting from the micro level activities and interactions between heterogeneous agents and between agents and the environment. Such models allow researchers to investigate theories which may otherwise be difficult to examine. We present a theoretically driven agent-based model to explore two perspectives on institutional change, rational choice and cultural diffusion, in the context of invasive plant management in Chitwan, Nepal. The Chitwan region is grappling with the spread of the invasive mile-a-minute weed, Mikania micrantha (Mikania). We focus on understanding which perspective of institutional change better fits empirical survey data on Mikania management. We find that rational choice is an unlikely candidate for institutional change in Chitwan and that the social learning and imitation mechanism modeled in the cultural diffusion perspective better replicates empirical patterns. Additionally, the model reveals that the percentage of agents adopting the best practice removal method is not as influential in reducing Mikania as the initial amount of Mikania removed. This result indicates that it may be useful to conduct an empirical assessment varying the initial amount of Mikania removed to understand the management implications for successful removal of Mikania in Chitwan and elsewhere.},

Agents with values and norms lead to simulation results that meet human needs for explanations, but have not been tested on their ability to reproduce human behaviour. This paper compares empirical data on human behaviour to simulated data on agents with values and norms in a psychological experiment on dividing money: the ultimatum game. We find that our agent model with values and norms produces aggregate behaviour that falls within the 95},

In particular, we argue why ABMS might serve as framework for many future energy system models that integrate many different algorithms. We then discuss practical and theoretical problems in the development, validation and assessment of energy-system-analytical ABMS and conclude with an outlook and recommendations for energy system modellers who consider incorporating ABMS into their modelling toolbox.},

As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design rationale, the model rsquo;s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model rsquo;s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},

Our focus is on exploring the dynamic process through which the behavior of individuals and the interpersonal relationships among them influence the macro-social attitude towards the stigma. We find that a norm of tolerance is best promoted when the population comprises both those whose conduct is driven by compassion for the stigmatized and those whose focus is on conforming with others in their social networks. A second finding is that less insular social networks encourage de-stigmatization when most people are compassionate, but it is instead more insularity that promotes tolerance when society is dominated by conformity.},

 abstract     = {Over the last few years, the use of agent-based simulations to study social systems has spread to many domains (e.g., geography, ecology, sociology, economy). These simulations aim to reproduce real life situations involving human beings and thus need to integrate complex agents to match the behavior of the simulated people. Therefore, notions such as cognition, emotions, personality, social relationships or norms have to be taken into account, but there is currently no agent architecture that could incorporate all these features and be used by the majority of modelers, including those with low levels of skills in programming. In this paper, the BEN (Behavior with Emotions and Norms) architecture is introduced to tackle this issue. It is a modular architecture based on the BDI model of cognition and featuring modules to add emotions, emotional contagion, personality, social relationships and norms to agent behavior. This architecture is integrated into the GAMA simulation platform. An application of BEN to the simulation of the evacuation of a nightclub on fire is presented and shows the complexity of behaviors that may be developed with this architecture to create credible and expressive simulations.},
