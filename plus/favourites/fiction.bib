Ian Campbell investigates the ways in which Arabic science fiction engages with a theoretical concept he terms {\textquotedblleft}double estrangement{\textquotedblright} wherein these texts provide social or political criticism through estrangement and simultaneously critique their own societies' inability or refusal to engage in the sort of modernization that would lead the Arab world back to leadership in science and technology.},
