On the way, he comes across plenty of animals and it gives him an idea for an adventure. Visiting his favourite fancy dress shop, he explains his idea to the Shopkeeper. The Shopkeeper immediately knows what to do and gives Mr Benn a pith helmet, whereupon he is magically transported to a jungle.

I don't feel like Ivor The Engine gets enough love, but its sweet and soothing nature where problems are never as bad as they seem certainly makes it worthy of more attention!
Therefore, I wrote this little piece to have a go at animating a demo scene from Ivor in the original style, using the original artwork (with thanks to 'The Art of Smallfilms').
It is very rugged at the best of times, and nothing really happens, but hopefully something I can improve upon as I try more stop-motion animating in the future, and perhaps a proper episode of Ivor. For now, big thanks to Stuart for bringing the characters and sounds to life:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiLs0CyiO0Mpi0lkRbn8Iug
and to SudrianSteam for the Ivor theme: https://soundcloud.com/user-56276101"

The first remake of it's kind shows the first ever Ivor the engine episode. The Ivor the engine was made from the Locolines plans but built using a stronger material by Andy, one of the CFR team. Thanks for watching and keep following!"

In 1972 it was repackaged and reissued as Camberwick Green with the following story (that I've had to split into two parts) now titled ""Peter Hazel Has An Adventure"".

Here's how the story might have looked if it had been animated."
