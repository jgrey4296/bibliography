Rob Lord composed quite an extended soundtrack for Discworld in MIDI-format. It consists of many different melodies, fitting a medieval but lighthearted magical world.
Back in the day, lots of game-music was composed with the ""Roland Sound Canvas-55"" in mind, so you could say this is the way it's supposed to sound. For example; compared to the Gravis Ultrasound-version, only in the Roland SC-55 version of the track ""The Mine, Inside"" (at 1:36:53) it sounds like dwarfs are humming along with the melody. Enjoy!

For the more robust Gravis Ultrasound-version of this score, see here: https://youtu.be/FQQDSwzJ5p0

TECHNICAL NOTES
- I used Roland's ""Sound Canvas VA"" for emulating the SC-55.
- All tracks are recorded 'ingame' using Dosbox-X 0.89.19"

#sonidodelluvia #lluvia #lluviarelajanteparadormir
Hola amigos
Soy fanático de la música de lluvia. He tenido problemas para dormir por la noche y estar estresado porque el trabajo es muy presión
Un día llovió, sentí a mi ser humano de la mejor manera, pateé para aprender sobre el sonido de la lluvia.
+ Y esto es lo que leo:
Existen diferentes estudios dedicados a cómo se asocia el invierno y el descanso del ser humano.
Uno de los grandes interrogantes que surgen a propósito de la época de lluvias que atraviesa hoy en día Colombia es si se puede descansar mejor pese al frío y el constante goteo por los aguaceros.

Según el cronobiólogo Naomi Rogers, el sol hace que nuestro cuerpo deje de producir melatonina, hormona encargada del sueño, por lo que si nos despertamos y está nublado, en el reloj interno de nuestro cuerpo nunca suena la alarma.

Además, el olor de la tierra después de una buena lluvia también es relajante para los seres humanos, ya que el agua hace que se mezclen los aceites acumulados de los árboles con una sustancia llamada geosemin, producida por las bacterias del suelo.

Las tormentas también despiertan la posibilidad de que se pueda oler el ozono, una molécula compuesta por tres átomos de oxígeno que se puede comparar con el olor a cloro o con el de la ropa limpia.

El cerebro y el descanso adecuado
A todo esto, podemos añadir que cuando dormimos, nuestro cerebro sigue funcionando y alerta ante cualquier perturbación que pueda producirse a nuestro alrededor, y uno de los mecanismos activos es recibir continua información sonora del entorno.

Es por ello, que los ruidos de personas hablando cerca, la televisión, altera nuestro organismo y las horas de sueño. Por otro lado,  el sonido constante de la lluvia fuerte o una tormenta, hacen que el cerebro trabaje de forma lenta y así tenga un mejor descanso.

La lluvia, sea de día o de noche, influye significativamente en los niveles de vitalidad y energía, y todo esto explica por qué los días de lluvia se genera un sentimiento de somnolencia.

El aroma de la lluvia trae paz
El olor a tierra mojada es tan característico que ayuda a relajar. Además, los días de lluvia que hay tormenta, el ambiente huele a ozono, una molécula compuesta por tres átomos de oxigeno que recuerda a sabanas limpias.

El sonido es un deleite para quienes buscan descansar mientras llueve
El sonido del chapoteo de la lluvia es muy reconfortante y ayuda a sentirnos cansados. Dado que este sonido se va repitiendo es llamado el “sonido rosa”, sonoridad de baja frecuencia que disminuye nuestra actividad cerebral.

Las hormonas también tienen un papel importante
En los días de lluvia hay menos luz solar y la estimulación disminuye considerablemente hasta el momento de sentirnos soñolientos. Por eso, nos podemos sentirnos también más tristes.

Con la unión de los tres factores biológicos, el individuo desarrolla un mecanismo de defensa y tranquilidad en el organismo que ocasiona indirectamente que el cuerpo descanse y se sienta más a gusto cuando el clima esta frío y es acompañado de una leve tormenta. . . . . .

""BioShock is a 2007 first-person shooter game developed by 2K Boston (later Irrational Games) and 2K Australia, and published by 2K Games. It is the first game in the BioShock series. The game's concept was developed by Irrational's creative lead, Ken Levine, and incorporates ideas by 20th century dystopian and utopian thinkers such as Ayn Rand, George Orwell, and Aldous Huxley, as well as historical figures such as John D. Rockefeller and Walt Disney. The game is considered a spiritual successor to the System Shock series, on which many of Irrational's team, including Levine, had worked previously.

BioShock is set in 1960. The player guides the protagonist, Jack, after his airplane crashes in the ocean near the bathysphere terminus that leads to the underwater city of Rapture. Built by the business magnate Andrew Ryan, the city was intended to be an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a genetic material which can be used to grant superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries to find a way to escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies, and the iconic, deadly Big Daddies, while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, can defeat foes in several ways by using weapons, utilizing plasmids that give unique powers, and by turning Rapture's defenses against them. It was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 platforms in August 2007; a PlayStation 3 port by Irrational, 2K Marin, 2K Australia and Digital Extremes was released in October 2008, and an OS X port by Feral Interactive in October 2009. A scaled-down mobile version was developed by IG Fun, which contained the first few levels of the game."""

About This Video:
A Phoenix kiln is a type of downdraft kiln where the firebox is below the ware chamber. It was developed in America in the 1970's by George Wright and gets it's name from the Phoenix workshops. It is classified as a downdraft kiln because the flames go up into the ware chamber and then down to the exit flue of the ware chambers before going up a chimney. I built one from mud to learn about how it works and to see how hot it gets.
The mud I used for the kiln is white clay from a flood area and it less than ideal for making pottery. I tested it and it worked ok but I knocked out the exit flue wall to make it behave more like a cross draft kiln before firing the pots. The kiln worked well in firing pottery despite the poor quality clay which cracked easily. If run for longer it probably would have reached higher temperatures.

About Primitive Technology:
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

About This Video:
I made a furnace insulated with wood ash to smelt iron in. Furnace insulation stops heat being lost from the walls of a furnace and so increases the heat within the furnace. Dry wood ash makes an excellent insulator for heat as the fine particles separated by small air gaps don't allow heat to conduct very well. To make the furnace a double layered wall of clay was made and the space between was filled with wood ash from different fires. The clay needed to be completely dry before doing so however as it was important the the ash not get wet, which would cause it to loose its insulating properties.The furnace was tested with an iron smelt and it produced 34g of iron from 10 charges of ore. It was going quickly to start with but then I had issues with the blower towards the end of the smelt (broken housing). The furnace design is promising though as this produced the third best smelt I've done in the wild with natural tools and materials (the best were 39g and 41g over a year ago). I'll try it again later when I've replaced the broken forge blower.

[Lore]... One hundred years ago, Hylians discovered the ancient relics of the Sheikah constructed ten thousand years prior, including the Guardians and the four Divine Beasts, used to protect the land of Hyrule. This discovery coincided with the prophecy about Ganon's return, thus King Rhoam and the people of Hyrule decided to create a group of warriors and protectors, namely, the Champions.

🔷▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬🔷

This video is created by using a range of tools to capture this environment in high definition. There's a combination of camera shots from around each major settlement in Hyrule. I have used a combination of layered sounds and techniques to improve the original game audio. Each area has its own individual rain tracks recorded over different surfaces such as wood planks or the ocean. Sounds from these location are reintroduced at a more fitting volume for instance the Kakariko chimes.

Today we're exploring the enchanting Korok Forest. 🍁🍃🍂
Sit down with Hestu, Chio and all their korok friends and listen to the rumble of thunder in the distance as the Great Deku Tree tells an age-old tale. Marvel at the legendary sword that seals the darkness, the great Master Sword as it slumbers in it's current resting place. As we travel through the forest, make sure not to stray too far into the Lost Woods however, as the mists have a tendency to lead you far from your path!

"t4_K0gg9cvE","Snowed In at the College of Winterhold | Music & Ambience from Skyrim's Northern Tundra | 3 Hours","Lost Music Co.","2023-10-15","2023-06-24","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t4_K0gg9cvE/hqdefault.jpg","The Snowy College of Winterhold, nestled amidst the breathtaking beauty of the northern reaches of Skyrim, stands as a beacon of ancient wisdom and arcane mastery. Perched atop a rugged cliff overlooking the frozen Sea of Ghosts, this legendary institution is renowned throughout Tamriel as the preeminent center for the study of magic.

The college's exterior, clad in weathered stone and adorned with intricate carvings, exudes an aura of mystique and grandeur. Its architecture is a harmonious blend of Nordic tradition and magical craftsmanship, with towering spires and pointed roofs crowned by snow-capped peaks. The college appears as if it emerged organically from the surrounding landscape, seamlessly blending into the wintry environment.

As one ventures inside the college's imposing entrance, they are greeted by a vast, vaulted hall known as the Hall of the Elements. Bathed in a soft, ethereal glow emitted by enchanted orbs, the hall hums with a palpable sense of energy and knowledge. Massive stone pillars support the weight of the arched ceiling, which is adorned with intricate runic symbols, reflecting the deep connection to magic present within these hallowed halls.

The interior of the college is a labyrinth of interconnected chambers and corridors, each holding its own secrets and treasures. Arcane laboratories buzz with activity as scholars and mages delve into the mysteries of the arcane arts, conducting experiments, and refining their skills. Libraries, with shelves stretching from floor to ceiling, house countless tomes of ancient lore, providing a vast repository of knowledge spanning centuries.

At the heart of the college lies the Midden, an enigmatic subterranean chamber shrouded in secrecy. Within its dimly lit depths, relics of forgotten times and potent artifacts await those who dare to explore its mysteries. The aura of power and the faint scent of aged parchment linger in the air, fostering an atmosphere of scholarly pursuits and intellectual curiosity.

Outside, the courtyard is blanketed in pristine white snow, with magical wards preventing the intrusion of the biting cold. Mages-in-training can be seen honing their skills, casting spells that send vibrant displays of elemental magic dancing through the air. The air itself crackles with raw energy, bearing witness to the profound talents and dedication of the students who call this place home.

Beyond its architectural splendor, the College of Winterhold is steeped in a rich history that stretches back to a time when the world was filled with awe-inspiring wonders. It has weathered countless trials and adversities, surviving the test of time and emerging as an enduring bastion of magical knowledge.

For those with a thirst for arcane wisdom or an adventurous spirit yearning to unlock the secrets of the cosmos, the Snowy College of Winterhold stands as an invitation to embark on a journey of enlightenment, where the pursuit of magic intertwines with the enchanting beauty of Skyrim's snowy landscapes.

In 2013, nuclear war devastated the Earth, wiping out billions of lives. Among the affected nations is Russia, including the now-desolate wasteland of Moscow. A handful of survivors manage to hide in the Metro system, salvaging spare parts and growing mushrooms for food. Animals such as rats or bears have mutated into horrific monsters, while the air in many areas becomes heavily irradiated and impossible to survive in without a gas mask.

Diamond City ~

Diamond City, also referred to as the ""Great Green Jewel,"" is a fortified settlement in the Fens neighborhood of Boston in 2287.It was built within Fenway Park, a pre-War baseball stadium. With its own police force, public school, robust agriculture and industry, and a great deal of economic influence across the region, it is by far the most prosperous settlement in the Commonwealth. Diamond City Radio, which can be heard across the Commonwealth, is a symbol of its prosperity and might. Despite this, it is still a shantytown contained within a baseball stadium.
