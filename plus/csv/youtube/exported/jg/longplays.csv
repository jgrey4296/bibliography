"WC-mKjDJl_U","Fable 3 - Longplay (Good Walkthrough) Full Game [No Commentary]","Loopy Longplays","2023-10-14","2019-05-10","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WC-mKjDJl_U/hqdefault.jpg","Fable 3 is quite the game, I played this one alot when it came out. A little to much, the biggest reason I did is because I loved Fable 2 so much. I wanted more Albion. This game has many flaws yes I see many of them. Fable 2 is better in so many ways. But I think this game does other things in a different or unique way. For one, the inventory system being in the sanctuary and seeing and looking at your items instead of a menu is really cool. I for one enjoyed it. The water, this sounds simple but it is my favorite water from any video game I have ever played, the way it looks is just wow. I could just sit there looking at it. Also some of the quests are unique I love the quest called ''The Game'' is one of my favorite Fable quests.

Sadly I have quite a few gripes with fable 3. One is the world, it feels kinda dead, fable 1 and 2 had funny and cool villagers,
 travelling salesmen, the open world feels linear with not much happening kill wolves, bandits, hollowmen or hobbes. But for no real purpose. But there is alot to find in the world Silver keys, golden keys, plants, and books. Another major thing wrong is the jobs they feel very meh, Fable 2 had woodcutting, blacksmith and bartendering all which felt very different and suited various playstyles. You want to hear the latest gossip and drunk villagers bartender, you want to go crazy forging swords blacksmith, you want to listen to the peaceful calm music and hear the wind blowing and rustling of the trees while you watch the sun rise and set become a woodcutter. Fable 3's mini jobs have you quickly pressing buttons with no sync and no real fun. Lute heroes the worst, I just want to play music, heck music from your own game :(
Two last things you need so much gold to much, and the rent system uhh that is garbage.. why they never added a repair all is beyond me, to tedious to own multiple proprieties and have to fix them every hour for 10mins of repair.

So listen I have annoyances with this game but there is alot of good, I mean Peter Molyneux himself said they easily needed another year of development on this game. His favorite Fable game is Fable 2. So anywho this game has an really well written and fun DLC which I will have a special longplay for coming soon. I want to close on a good note I have played this game alot I loved the open desert, The creepy quest  in the desert with Walter and you stranded there. Becoming a ruler and having to make tough decisions is not easy and that was unique to play too.

Anyways look how much I have written about this game, believe I could go into way more detail and talk way more about it but bottom line is its fun and despite its rough spots it still is fun to play. With all this being said I hope you enjoy this longplay :)

I was a fan of Fable 2, I loved the interaction with the people, the cities, and how you could make the game your own. Fable 3 is a good successor to the Fable storyline. The main plot is engaging and the wit/humor found within keeps you laughing. The game does a good job of mixing up the action, bringing you to different places and having you accomplish varying tasks throughout. However, Fable 3 is essentially a cut down version of Fable 2. While removing the menus was generally a good thing, the Fable 3 team went too far. -

A very scary teaser game for a cancelled game that everybody wanted.

 The game is very confusing especially the very end on what exactly you need to do but I managed to do it somehow and edited out a bit of me wandering around because for the last part it seems you need a microphone plugged into your PS4 and I didn't realise that mine wasn't plugged in all the way until very late while recording but I edited that part out

 I didn't even get a PS4 until this game was already off the PSN store but I managed to put it on my account through a friend's PS4 so I had to do some proxy magic in order to download the game -

I wanted to aim for an all alfheim and encounters run however I missed one encounter on one of the last chapters. I began the encounter but I couldnt find the last spawn. All alfheims are completed however.

The game is more difficult than I remember but I feel i get the hang of it towards the end. There is one mob encounter that I always seem to fail at however, and one bad encounter can screw you over quite badly. I probably should have experimented with more of the weapons as well, as once I found a nice combo or two I tended to stick at it.

From what I remember there was one time I had edit in a different run for that chapter due to reasons. So the end trophies for that chapter may not line up. I ended up being one shotted quite a few times by the end boss, when you continue you end up in the middle of the fight. I edited this death out but the cut will not be perfect. I edit one more death out in the game like this were an instant kill move got me. End trophies may not align due to this, as deaths give you huge penalties in the end. I get lost a couple of times during the game, or I forget what to do, but they're relativity short lived.

Machinarium is award-winning independent puzzle / adventure game developed by the makers of popular web-games Samorost and Samorost2. A little robot who's been thrown out to the scrap yard behind the city must return and confront the Black Cap Brotherhood and save his robot-girl friend. World: Machinarium world is populated only by robots...

Machinarium is a puzzle point-and-click adventure game developed by Amanita Design. It was released on October 16, 2009 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. PC and Mac demos were made available on September 30, 2009. It is also being scheduled for a future release for Wii's WiiWare.

The goal of Machinarium is to solve a series of puzzles and brain teasers. The puzzles are linked together by an overworld consisting of a traditional ""point and click"" adventure story. The overworld's most radical departure is that only objects within the player character's reach can be clicked on.

Machinarium is notable in that it contains no dialogue, neither spoken nor written. The game instead uses a system of animated thought bubbles. Easter egg back story scenes in the same format can only be revealed by idling in certain areas.

(I did not use the walkthrough system....they each have a stupid mini-shooter you must complete in order to open the walkthrough pages):
The game employs a two-tier hint system. Once per level, the player can receive a hint, which becomes increasingly vague as the game progresses. Machinarium also comes with a walkthrough, that can be accessed at any time by playing a minigame. As with dialogue, the walkthrough is not in written or spoken form, but instead a series of sketches describing the puzzle at hand and its solution. However, the walkthrough only reveals what must be done in that area, and not how that puzzle relates to the game chronology.


Machinarium opens with an overview of the eponymous city as a disposal flier launches from its highest tower. The player character, a robot called Josef (named after Josef ?apek, the creator of the word ""robot"" and brother to Karel ?apek)[8] is dumped on a scrapheap, where he re-assembles himself and sets off for the city. Entering the city, he discovers a plot by the Black Cap Brotherhood, his three thuggish antagonists, to blow up the city's tower. Unfortunately, he is himself discovered and locked up. After breaking out of prison, Josef aids the citizens of the city, as he discovers the mischief which the Brotherhood has been working. Shortly after flooding the bad guys' room (leaving them helpless), Josef locates his girlfriend, who has been locked up and forced to cook. Unable to free her, he works his way to the top of the tower where he finds the room where the story began. A huge-headed robot sits in the middle of the room, incapacitated and gibbering. Josef recalls how the three of them lived happily until the Black Cap Brotherhood zapped this friend and kidnapped the girl. When a garbage sucker arrived to dispose of the Black cap thug, it gets Josef instead. After this revelation, Josef restores his friend to sanity, dumps the Brotherhood down a drain, and frees his girlfriend. The two of them climb back to the tower, wave goodbye to their friend, and fly off into the sunset. In the final closing scene, their vehicle suffers a collision and falls, and they are seen being carried away separately by two fliers.

An ambitious game, and a lot of fun. Looks like they put a lot of effort into the 3D but still some characters are very pixelated - just the state of the art in 1997 i guess.
Some notes: I didn't think to show off the KIA much. The shooting range has a ""bug"" where the targets take forever to pop up when running the game on modern PCs, some edits are a little rough (sorry, still learning!). I didn't need to go back to the police station before killing Dektora. I tried to VK Lucy as human, but she was a replicant every time. Clovis leaves poetry on your answering machine every night if you spend enough time in the game.
At 01:07:45, that's supposed to be Deckard in the movie talking to the fish lady.
Thanks to Evil Surge for his walkthrough.
Some alternative scenes at the end of the video:
- Dodge soup, kill special, let Zuben live
- Poisoned by Early Q
- Let Dektora live
- Badass rat
- Type pogo in KIA
- Wtf?
- The (kinda creepy) Lucy ending -

Read my article on the game @ https://www.vintageisthenewold.com/retro-revisited-we-review-the-original-syndicate-and-rediscover-a-true-action-strategy-gem/
Developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1993

Set in a dystopian future where the wealth and power of corporations rivals that of governments, Eurocorp perfects a new microprocessor, known as the CHIP. Inserted at the base of the neck, the chip alters the perception of the host so that they see the world as they wish to; the ultimate hallucinogenic. However, the CHIP also gives host corporation access to any memories and information present in the host's brain, including bank details and other sensitive information.

As an executive within one of these syndicates, it is up to you to take control of global CHIP production using your team of cybernetically enhanced agents and to ruthlessly crush all who might stand in your way.

Syndicate is a blend of squad-based tactical shooting, resource management and explosive action. You faces a series of fifty or so missions set across the globe, each of which requires you carry out tasks that ultimately increase your syndicate's influence, earning you increased revenues and even more difficult challenges.

The over-world section that precludes each mission allows you to set tax revenues for each of the countries that you own, as well as choose equipment load-outs and modifications to your squad. It's worth paying attention to the mission briefings as these giver you a good idea for the level of resistance you're likely to meet, as well as recommendations for pieces of equipment required to complete the mission.

Another vital part of this section is investing funds in researching new weapons and upgrades for your agents. Each cyborg can be equipped with upgraded limbs, improving their survivability and general abilities. The tech tree is extensive enough to mean that you're unlocking new weapons and upgrades throughout most of the game and this helps keep things fresh.

Once you're finished loading up, it's time to tackle the next mission.

Viewed from an isometric perspective, commands are issued to your agents using a combination of mouse and keyboard short-cuts. Clicking on the ground will instruct the selected agents to move to that location, whilst clicking on NPCs and vehicles will make your agents follow the target.

Weapons can be equipped by clicking on the corresponding slot in the inventory panel. If the square is red then this means that the weapon/item is active and ready to use. Players should be mindful that the city's law enforcement won't tolerate agents carrying weapons openly and will respond with force.

One of the most interesting features of the game is the IPA system: intelligence, perception and adrenaline. Each agent has three sliders that alter movement speed (red), accuracy with weapons (blue) and autonomy to deal with hostile threats (yellow). Trying to micro-manage your squad can be a tough task, particularly when attacked from multiple hostiles so having your agents able to look after themselves is essential. Cybernetic upgrades increase the duration that you can boot agent abilities before expiring, so researching these mods early is a really good idea.

The 640 x 480 resolution meant that the graphics looked really sharp for their time and the attention to detail in all of the building tile-sets is really quite astounding. The cities are grim, crumbling urban centres packed with neon signs, tenements and general squalor, filled with civilians going about the daily drudge of their lives. Bullfrog's goal with Syndicate was to simulate the feel of a living, breathing city and they succeeded given the technology of the time.

The audio effects and music are also excellent. Each weapon has unique sounds, all of which resonate with suitably bassy rumbles when fired. The game also makes use of dynamic music with the pace and tone changing noticeably when enemy agents are close and is a great touch.

As for negatives, the only real annoyance I experienced was the sometimes infuriating pathing of the agents, especially when in vehicles. Agents head in a straight line towards their objective and often get stuck inside buildings or end up in places that you clearly didn't intend. Herding crowds of persuaded civilians through doors and gates can often be an exercise in frustration, particularly when you find that the one person you were meant to be escorting has got themselves stuck inside a building several streets away.

Before I started recording this longplay, I feared that the game might seem dated. However, those fears melted away as I started ripping apart enemy agents with my minigun-toting agents. Syndicate was one my favourite games growing up and it's still a hell of a lot of fun even today - highly recommended!

Release Date: 01 November 1995

""A DEEP SPACE ADVENTURE BY SEAN CLARK IN COLLABORATION WITH FILMMAKER STEVEN SPIELBERG

An asteroid the size of a small moon is on a crash course toward Earth, and only NASA veteran Boston Low has the expertise to stop it. Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink.

Once the wayward asteroid is nuked into a safe orbit, the trio conducts a routine examination of the rocky surface.
What they uncover is anything but routine.

Low, Brink and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The team is hurtled across the galaxy to a planet so desolate, Brink is moved to name it Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante’s inferno. The bleak landscape was obviously once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels.

But no Cocytans.

Who were the original inhabitants of this once rich empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins, and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unraveling in the face of such uncertainty? To return to Earth, they must dig for answers, both on the planet’s surface and deep within themselves.

From the combined talents of LucasArts and legendary Steven Spielberg comes an epic adventure that plunges headlong into the very core of the unknown. And takes you with it.

Nearly 200 locations and hundreds of puzzles
Robert Patrick of T2 as the voice of Boston Low
Special effects contributed by Industrial Light & Magic
Dialogue contributed by award-winning sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card
Alluring Wagnerian musical score sets the epic tone""

Game played and recorded in 1440p60 resolution, using a Morrowind Graphics Extender to make use of high quality antialiasing, water reflections, god rays and shaders and much improved viewing distances (yes, it's not really vanilla this way, with no thick layers of fog anymore, I agree on that).

In hereby video I present all the main quests, while not skipping or clicking through vast majority of the dialogue, and also asking some of the more interesting questions/topics. As well as read some books, so you could read it at your leisure. Basically, a big chunk of the main quest lore is there.

NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN ALL SUBQUESTS  OR 100% LONGPLAY, just a simple main quest walkthrough speedrun, where I use cheats for gold and invincibility (sometimes even that wouldn't stop me from dying, believe it or not), so the video could be actually finished in less than 12 hours youtube limit, and less than about 30-35 hours it would take me to finish it without the ""help"". THERE IS NO WAY I COULD HAVE FINISHED THE GAME IN 8 HOURS NORMALY. THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING SKIPPED except for the travel between the towns, and back to towns after visiting required dungeons. All quests are presented here fully. I would get killed in one-two shots by literally almost everything in the late game. Huge numbers of quickloads and quicksaves in an RPG game is not what I see as a good longplay. Main quest literally REQUIRES of you to level up, and you can do it only by gaining skills, either by paying the trainers, or doing a shitload of quests, One of the first things I do is give myself 100 Speed Attribute, so the movement speed of my character is at least SOMEWHAT bearable. This is a huge, expansive, and mighty difficult game when played casually. Difficulty slider was at nearly all times on the 0 point, the Normal Difficulty level. Only for a few minutes here and there I've dulled it to -15 so the hordes of the flying rats would die faster. Fokin' rats.

Played as a Dark Elf N'wah, a sort of Long Blade, Medium/Heavy Armor Fighter, with at least some magic, like levitation and speed improvement. Basically the easiest class of character to speedrun the main quest.

If you enjoyed this walkthrough, and are wishing for more, threat not much longer, as the Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansions are coming along soonTM after this video, they are already recorded and ready to be published. They are both about 40% length of the main game.

I have not gone for all Ash Vampires, as they are not mandatory, their items are mostly pure loot.

Perhaps it's a shame I haven't tried to kill Vivec when I had the chance, but I roleplayed the game as a sort of ""lawful neutral"" character, going by D&D characteristics. Just didn't feel right to murder him.

Boots of Blinding Speed used regularly, and you know damn well why if you watch the video. Of course, I was too lazy to get an actual Dispel spell or item until about halfway or so, so I could just fly/run around while actually seeing anything.
