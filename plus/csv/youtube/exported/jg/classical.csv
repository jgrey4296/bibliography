"6xp5ykFoEt0","Kronos Quartet: ""Testimony"" by Charlton Singleton","Kronos Quartet","2023-10-14","2021-02-15","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6xp5ykFoEt0/hqdefault.jpg","Kronos Quartet performs ""Testimony,"" which was written for Fifty for the Future: The Kronos Learning Repertoire.

Charlton Singleton often draws inspiration from the Gullah culture of the American Southeast's Lowcountry region, where he grew up. In addition to his roles as speaker, composer, and arranger, Singleton also performs as part of Ranky Tanky, a group that specializes in jazz-influenced arrangements of traditional Gullah music. Singleton based Testimony on musical practices of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in which his father was a pastor. During his childhood, a cappella Prayer Bands of three or four people had the responsibility of getting the congregation ready for worship. Notes Singleton, ‚ÄúTestimony is written from the Prayer Band experience, and from specific rhythms in African American churches and communities ‚Äì the ‚ÄòGullah Clap‚Äô (on beats two, two-and, and four) and the ‚ÄòHalf Clap‚Äô (on beat one only).‚Äù

Kronos Quartet:
David Harrington, violin
John Sherba, violin
Hank Dutt, viola
Sunny Yang, cello

This performance of Testimony was filmed October 2, 2020 at Bing Concert Hall, The Leland Stanford Junior University (Stanford University):
