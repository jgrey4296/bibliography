**********************************

The Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is probably the drink I get the most request for, and it's finally time to do it, because Saturday is Towel Day- May 25th is of course the date the Vogons demolish the Earth to make way for a new hyperspace lane.  So long, and thanks for all the fish!  Well let's smash our brains out with this perfectly excellent drink.

Invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is said to be the greatest drink in existence and to be like the experience of having ones brains smashed out by a wedge of lemon wrapped around a gold brick.  Sounds fun!  The book does of course give a recipe but being a lowly strag stuck here on Earth I'm unable to procure frankly... any of it.  But fear not!  I think we can find suitable substitutes, and that is exactly what I endeavor to do this week on How to Drink.

Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster (#1)

2 oz. -or- 60 ml. London Dry Gin
3-4 dashes 20% Saline Solution
stir over ice, strain into coupe
Smoke with Bog Peat
Top with Seltzer
Float a barspoon of Fernet Branca
Garnish with a twist of lemon
Drink, But very carefully.

**********************************

The Ward 8 is a classic drink from way back in 1908, named for the 8th Ward of Boston and created in honor of Ward Boss Martin ""the Mahatma"" Lomasney. I made this drink and immediately hated it.  I had other people in the room try it, reviews were mixed.  Frankly, I think it tasted like an old dirty foot.  So I remade it and created a drink I call a Ward 8 and A Half.  Here's both

Ward 8
.25 oz. -or- 8 ml. Grenadine
.25 oz. -or- 8 ml. Orange Juice
.5 oz. -or- 15 ml. Lemon Juice

**********************************

The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit has been something of a favorite among the counter cultural crowd since it's publication, much to J.R.R. Tolkien's chagrin!  It's true, he was not a fan of the hippies who so loved his work, and actually actively worked to prevent his books publication in the United States where the wrong sort of people were enjoying it.  Kind of a killjoy, right?  In the end though, money won out the day, the book got published, the hippies all got executive level jobs, and everything turned green.  Which brings me to this cocktail, a combination of Jameson Whiskey, CBD oil and Amaro Cio Ciaro, it's a easy sipping nod to the Ent-Draught served by Treebeard to Merry and Pippin when they're in his care.  The books describe his heady brew as tasting like a cool breeze blown through a deep and mossy forest, which is pretty evocative!  Happily I found that this CBD from FxCBD did most of the work for me in the flavor department.  CBD in food and drinks is a growing trend I can't ignore, and while I can't verify the health bennifits of ingesting CBD, I can clearly see it's making plenty of people feel better, and I can suggest a tasty recipe it works well in a cocktail for.  Here it is:

Ent-Draught
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Irish Whiskey
~.25 oz. -or- ~7ml. Amaro Cio Ciaro
An Eye Dropper of CBD Oil
Stir over ice
Serve up
Garnish with rosemary sprig

"YKXIxbH29os","Drinks from Cowboy Bebop  | How to Drink","How To Drink","2023-10-14","2020-01-31","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YKXIxbH29os/hqdefault.jpg","I recreated all the drinks specifically mentioned in Cowboy Bebop, and improved on one of them. Hope to See you Space Cowboy...

You can shop for the spirits I use on the show here: http://bit.ly/H2D-Spirits-Cowboy

Cowboy Bebop is probably my favorite anime, it originally aired in 1998 when I was in highschool and it really stuck with me. I'd never seen anything like it before, it was so mature, and adult, and dark and incredibly animated, it was groundbreaking stuff. In fact, in Japan only 12 of the original episodes made it past censors to air, and in the U.S. it was the launch title for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. I'd seen anime before (Akira, Ninja Scroll, etc.) but this was the first time I'd ever seen a broadcast anime show that had the same thing going on those feature film titles did. The show follows the exploits of Spike, Jett, Faye, Ed and Ein as they bounce around on the Bebop (Jett's spaceship) hunting bounties in a post Earth apocalypse future. It's an enormously fun space-western noir that deals with some heavy and adult issues, and was well ahead of it's time on representation. There's a LOT of drinking in this show, but in doing a ton of research on it, I find only three instances of the characters enjoying any specific drinks (There is one other moment during a firefight when Spike samples a martini from a shaker and remarks that it has too much vermouth): The Cowboy, a Prairie Oyster with gin, and a hot Vodka, so let's make em.

Prairie Oyster
• One egg yolk
• Pinch of Salt & pepper
• Two dashes Worcestershire sauce
• One dash hot sauce
• 1 oz. -or- 30 ml. Gin
• Build & Shoot

Cowboy
• 1 oz. -or- 30 ml. Half & Half
• 2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Bourbon
• Shake & Strain

Vodka Toddy
• .5 oz. -or- 15 ml. Rosemary Syrup
• Four Thin Lemon Wheels
• 2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Vodka
• 4 oz. -or- 120 ml. Hot Water
• two rosemary sprigs
• build in glass

Bright Cellars is the monthly wine club that matches you with wine that you’ll love. Get started by taking the taste palate quiz to see your personalized matches.

Well, this episode is a weird one. The first part was shot months ago, long before Covid 19 was around. The ending I finally shot the other day. The idea here was that it's 2020, the roaring 20's, prohibition, bath tub gin, get it? But now, 2020 isn't about the roaring 20's at all, it's about something else. So, who knows if this is still relevant? Idunno. Long story short, I kinda made my own gin. Yes, it's brown/yellow and ugly, yes I had to cancel half the plan of this episode, but it's gin dang it, and I made it, so it's mine. Basically, gin is infused neutral grain spirits, I know it's a bit more complicated than that if you want to get technical, but really that's what the stuff is. So I did a little research and stood on the shoulders of giants (Namely, Jeffrey Morgenthaler) and did three infusions and blended them to make my own ""Gin"".

Batch A (Morgenthaler)
750 ml. Everclear
20 g. Dried Juniper Berries
8 g. Coriander, Crushed
2 g. Dry orange peel
2 g. Dry lemon peel
3 g. cinnamon stick
1 cardamom pod, crushed

Batch B
750 ml. Everclear
40 g. Dried Juniper
6 g. Coriander
15 g. Bitter orange peel
2 g. Winter Green
9 g. dired lime

Batch C
750 ml. Everclear
35 g. Dried Juniper
1 cinnamon stick
50 g. Fresh orange peel
20 g. fresh lemon peel
20 g. fresh lime peel

My Ideal blend worked out to be 3 parts batch A, 2 Parts batch B, and 1 Part Batch C.

DISH NAME
ORIGINAL c.1740BC RECIPE (From The Yale Babylonian Tablets)
Tuh’u sirum saqum izzaz me tukan lipia tanaddi tusammat tabatum sikara susikillum egegerum kisibirrum smidu kamunum alutum tukammas-ma karsum hazannum teterri kisibirrum ina muhhi sipki tusappah suhutinnu kisibirrum isarutu tanaddi.

Tuh’u. Lamb leg meat is used. Prepare water. Add fat. Sear. Add in salt, beer, onion, arugula, cilantro, samidu, cumin, and beets. Put the ingredients in the cooking vessel and add crushed leek and garlic. Sprinkle the cooked mixture with coriander on top. Add suhutinnu and fresh cilantro.

MODERN RECIPE
INGREDIENTS
- 1lb (450g) Leg of Lamb Chopped into bite size pieces.
- 3-4 Tablespoon Oil or Rendered Fat
- 1 ½ teaspoons Salt
- 2 Cups (475ml) Water
- 12 oz (350ml) Beer - (A sour beer and German Weissbier are recommended, but any non-hoppy beer will suffice)
- 1 Large Onion Chopped
- 2 Cups Arugula Chopped
- 3/4 Cup Cilantro Chopped
- 2 Teaspoons Cumin Seeds crushed
- 2 Large Beets (approx. 4 cups) Chopped
- 1 Large Leek Minced
- 3 cloves Garlic,
- 1 Tablespoon Dry Coriander Seeds
- Additional Chopped Cilantro for garnish
- Samidu* (Something akin to 1 Persian Shallot)
- Suhutinnu* (Something akin to Egyptian Leek for garnish)
*These ingredients have no definite translation; the shallot and leek are the best guesses of scholars at Yale and Harvard Universities)

METHOD
1. Add the oil/fat to a large pot and set over high heat. Sear the lamb for several minutes in the oil until lightly browned.
2. Add the onions and let cook for 5 minutes, then add the beets and let cook for 5 minutes. Then add the salt, beer, arugula, cilantro, samidu (shallot) and cumin and bring to a boil. Mash the garlic into a paste and mix with the leek, then add to the pot.
3. Lower heat to medium and let simmer for approximately 1 hour, or until the beets and meat are cooked to your liking.
4. Once cooked, dish it into a bowl and sprinkle with coriander seeds. Garnish with fresh cilantro and suhutinnu (leek)

"_QsCrcLG6Mo","This Episode tried to Kill me | How to Drink","How To Drink","2023-10-14","2021-02-05","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QsCrcLG6Mo/hqdefault.jpg","I set out to find the perfect Manhattan by making 42 of them.

In an earlier episode, the Vesper Martini specifically, I mused about the idea of a drink matrix: taking two variables, plotting them on an X and Y axis and running through them all. It seemed like a fun idea, and I asked twitter what I should start with, and the most common answer was a Manhattan. Seven ryes crossed by six vermouths yield forty two drinks, which got me into a bit of trouble as you'll see in this episode. But I also think this is super interesting and really informative, and there's some real surprises here too.

Whiskies (in order of line up):
Michter's Kentucky Straight Rye
Rittenhouse Straight Rye
Old Forester Kentucky Straight Rye
Whistle Pig Straight Rye
Alberta Premium Cask Strength Rye
Bulleit Straight American Rye
High West Rendezvous Rye

Matrix Timeline by Row:
00:00​ -  Explaining the plan
05:14​ - Martini and Rossi Sweet Vermouth
10:54​ - Noilly Prat Rouge Vermouth
16:35​ - Carpano Antica Formula Sweet Vermouth
23:48​ - Punt E Mes Sweet Vermouth
31:24​ - Dolin Sweet Vermouth
37:56​ - Starlino Hotel Rosso Vermouth

After all that Greg's Favorite is Antica Formula with Alberta Premium
