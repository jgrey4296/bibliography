The Ishimura used to be the longest section of the game with practically no glitches, now its one of the most broken parts of the entire run, lets take a look at how that happened.

In this installment of SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we go over how Alien: Isolation speedrun world record holder, xEB, beats the game in 22 minutes. This run utilizes some major sequence breaks, using one of the games only mechanics, crouching, to clip through walls (crouch clipping). In addition to that, most of the missions are skipped, and some other useful tech is used, such as silent running, letting you get past aliens without detection.

In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we break down the Any% (No Major Glitches) speedrun of Hollow Knight, performed by the former world record holder, Lep. This run includes some glitches and skips, including using your Shade to skip parts of the map, hitting levers through floors, and a glitch that pretty much lets you get super speed (although its use is limited in this category as it's considered a major glitch in certain applications). This video serves as an explanation of the strategies used by Lep to beat Hollow Knight in around 30 minutes. Had to make sure that this speedrun was covered on the tomatoanus channel before Silksong released ;)

In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we go over one of the greater challenges in HITMAN 3 speedrunning: beating the game (Season 3) with the Silent Assassin rating on every mission, all while never changing out of our starting suit (Suit Only). This run is done by the world record holder, HOUSEN, who demonstrates both a mastery and breadth of knowledge of the games mechanics, its exploits, and glitches, allowing him to beat all Season 3 missions in only five minutes. This is all before the Freelancer mode recently released, so particle boosts (with muffins of course) are still in the game!

In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we break down an Any% (No SLA) speedrun of Portal 2. This run is performed by Msushi, one of the top runners for this game. This run disallows saving and loading due to those features being able to easily break the game, and also disallows going out-of-bounds. What this run DOES include though, is tight movement (such as bunnyhopping), cutscene skips, glitches, exploits, and solving a lot of the chambers in just a few seconds. This video serves as an explanation of the strategies used by Msushi (and other speedrunners) to beat Portal 2 in under an hour.

#Portal2 #SourceEngine #Speedrun

Fullbright is more or less just increased brightness, and is something you can set up in the preference files of Portal 2. Fullbright makes it a lot easier for speedrunners to navigate dark levels, but Msushi mainly has it on for you at home since he can actually navigate the levels pretty decently in the dark. You're able to set up your preference files so that individual levels load with fullbright on, so that you don't need to go into any settings or anything when you load into dark levels.

5:08 - Your vertical velocity doesn't affect the speedlock, only your overall horizontal velocity.

12:24 - The Laser Switch Glitch (LSG) is actually what's described at 19:20, and just so happens to be often used on doors. The door thing itself is not LSG and doesn't really have a name.

12:34 - Ticks aren't the same as frames, they're a fixed interval of 1/60 of a second (0.0166s).

12:43 - This glitch isn't due to an overlap in the hitboxes, but rather a strange consequence of the fact that the door hitbox is entirely behind the portal.

13:51 - This glitch isn't related to the number of entities, but rather is a strange bug caused by a system implemented to prevent timing issues with buttons whose output is on a delay. See https://wiki.portal2.sr/Button_Glitch for details.

19:20 - LSG isn't caused by the portal decay and laser staying in place for a moment, but rather is caused by the laser receiver staying on for a short amount of time after the laser itself disappears.

1:00:30 - The funnel counter actually only goes up to 2 after he uncrouches again, since this glitch is really caused by ~changing~ whether you're crouched whilst standing still in a funnel. See https://wiki.portal2.sr/Crouch_Fly_Glitch for details."

#BioShock #Speedrun

The first fling in the run, which saves ten seconds, is specifically called ‚ÄúYOLO fling‚Äù since it was a known about fling, but it wasn‚Äôt done in runs due to its difficulty. KPC was on a run that was pretty much dead and decided to say YOLO and try the fling since he knew about it, and ended up getting it first try. This led to him pulling the run back to be a world record, making the fling just become part of the route. Gotta love glitches and moments like that in speedruns/speedrunning."

In this video, we cover the Any% speedrun of Bloodborne, with the stipulations that the run is done on the current patch and that no clipping is performed by use of enemy grabs. This run is performed by Pinkman, who sets a blistering pace through Yharnam utilizing skips, farming Blood Echoes and Insight, and just absolutely demolishing bosses. Included in this run (which is completed in under 30 minutes) is a glitch that allows you to duplicate items.
