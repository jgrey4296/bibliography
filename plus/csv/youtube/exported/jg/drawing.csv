Level up your anatomy and structural drawing! Lets Draw Some TEETH!!!
In this video we go over the concept of Suggestion as it relates to drawing. And especially as it relates to drawing teeth.

Often to draw well we need to understand the underlying form in detail... so we can softly hint at it. A few light strokes can be all you need... as long as you know what's meant to be there.

Teeth are a great way to understand this idea!

How Many Teeth Should You Draw??? : https://youtu.be/oY0liwRZQnA

A big part of the art journey is figuring out how you apply these concepts into your own work and style!

If you want to learn about the techniques I am using based on the Loomis Method you can check out these videos:

With most types of stylised types of art - There is often a mix of structure and perspective and technical drawing.... combined with symbols and abstract features.



Happy Drawing!

Correction: Accumulate Field node's ""Total"" output does not tell you how many elemtns have been counted, it returns the sum total of whatever values it has counted up. When the Value is 1 as in mine, that means it added 1 per element which is why I worded it that way.
