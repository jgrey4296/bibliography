Expert MVM is a ton of fun, but a lot of people tend to flail around not knowing what to do until they eventually give up, claiming it's just too hard for them. In reality it's actually really simple and easy, if a bit silly. Hopefully this video can show you how to crush expert between your fingers as easily as the high tours.

Yes I snatched the opening to the heavy section from LazyPurple. It fits in perfectly with the opening premise of positioning for heavy and doubly serves as a nice reference to one of my favorite creators. I think it's pretty obvious that I took it in good faith and that it's sign of how much I respect him. If he asks me to take the video down for it I will, I can reupload it without that section.

 - How I feel finally being done with this video.

This video was a HUGE rollercoaster of waning motivation, busting my ass, learning how to animate and a drive to make something I can be proud(heh) to show other people and say I made. I think I've succeeded.

This video is really rough around the edges, I'm aware. There are hundreds of things I can think of to improve, but doing so would require basically starting a lot of areas over. For now, this is good enough. My next big project will sand off a lot of the edges, and I hope to keep improving every single project I make. More on that in a future video though.

There are references to almost all of my favorite youtubers sprinkled throughout this video. See if you can spot all of them!

What do Runescape, Team Fortress 2, Eve Online and CS:GO all have in common?

If you said Trading then you hit the nail on the head.

Trading is, for better or worse, a core part of these games. And in-game economies can be scarily similar to economies in the real world. From inflation, to gambling, To full time workers and gold farmers, to taxes, to warfare, with their own legal tender to spend on these things...

Trading in videogames is worth real world money, and when real money is on the line, people will do anything..."

Q. How can I play TF2?
it’s free on steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/

Q. How do I get my game to run better/look better?
Default TF2 settings are HORRIBLE. Seriously unplayable.
https://mastercomfig.com/ Use this to create a graphics/net config (dw about the addons)
https://huds.tf/ You can find a custom hud here to make your game prettier/cleaner.

Q. What is the 1v1 gamemode at 5:43?
MGE. You can find some public servers on https://serverlist.tf/, but you’re probably best off finding a friend to 1v1 with.

Other similar gamemodes include:
Pass Time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eKO9BTNTOQ
bball: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sktFjn3wWOE
Ultiduo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhG7O5N_F1E

Q. How can I try competitive TF2?
There have been a lot of pick-up-game sites/systems that have come and gone, but the big ones coming soon™️ will be RGL pugs and FACEIT pugs. I’ll update this when they finally come out. For now, you can try:
LEAGUES:
https://rgl.gg/ the main NA competitive league
https://etf2l.org/ European League
https://ozfortress.com/ Australian League
https://asiafortress.com/ AsiaFortress

PUGS:
https://newbie.tf/ NA Newbie Mixes, designed to introduce new players to 6s fundamentals every Friday.
https://tf2center.com/ 500 hours in-game required, low quality pugs
https://discord.io/rahmix EU pugs. Pugs meant for new players take place every Friday at 18 CET!
https://discord.gg/ybSYAd9 - tf2cc, hosts open-level pugs for NA and hosts resources for new players

OTHER SERVERS:

PUBS:
steam://connect/pinguefy.game.nfoservers.com:27015 Experimental pub server that I'm hosting (paste the link into your browser or paste ""connect pinguefy.game.nfoservers.com:27015"" into your in-game console)
Competitive classes only, competitive mappool, and an item whitelist. Just a pub server without all of the silliness that makes casual TF2 what it is. Hoping this will give people a taste of what competitive TF2 is like in a low stress environment.
https://uncletopia.com/servers No crit, no spread pubs
- NA Casual is playable now and there are endless pub servers you can find in the server browser for normal pubs.

ROCKET JUMPING:
https://www.teamfortress.tv/servers/?region=na Try jump_academy if you’ve never jumped before!

Q. Is 6v6 the only competitive format?
No, there are a few other formats that people play, but are less popular:
Highlander (9v9, one of each class): https://youtu.be/DMb0Dxu6FaM?t=702
4v4: https://youtu.be/efqrJL4bgAc?t=1287
Prolander (7v7): https://youtu.be/Fvs2FV4uEXE?t=494

Q. Doesn’t TF2 have P2W weapons?
Most of the time stock weapons are the best choice, but for the few cases in which there are other options (soldier melee, medic crossbow, etc.) you can exchange your items for other items at https://scrap.tf/.

Q. How can I learn more about competitive TF2?
https://newbie.tf/tf2-basics/ basic comp tf2 fundamentals
there aren’t a whole lot of general comp tf2 videos out there, you might have some luck looking for demo reviews or map reviews, or just watch some matches if you’re totally new!

NeverKnowsBest video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P4xJ34dmqQ

So NeverKnowsBest accurately identified Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Planescape: Torment as the most influential CRPGs of all time. Medieval fantasy and Post Apocalypse are arguably the most popular themes in the CRPG world and Baldur's Gate II and Fallout are its genre-defining pillars. That explains why we've had a slew of games who have tried hard to build upon the legacy of these timeless classics. Some games like Pillars of Eternity have tried to adhere very closely to their sources of inspiration in terms of, not only mechanics, but also aesthetics, level design and atmosphere. Some others like Underrail have stripped their source of inspiration to the core and used as the main ingredient for a dish that's rich in taste due to the plethora of other influences. The X-files, Blade Runner and Running Man influences are strong in this one!"

Wii Play (2006) had a great assortment of little games, each with a little gem of adaptive music, but none got as intricate as the final one, Tanks!, in which you battle with little toy tanks on a hardwood floor. Check out how much variety you can get out of a few measures of music and some clever game design parameters.

Speakers:

Josh Grams has been a math geek, a word nerd and a mostly-hobbyist programmer since he was a kid, and a full-time small organic farmer since 2007. Has played a lot of the Discworld MUD and a fair amount of IF but never gotten around to writing any himself...

Cat Manning

Description:

Quality-based narrative is a surprisingly common technique in narrative design: some designers use it without realizing that’s what they’re doing. This enormously versatile model offers many advantages, but leveraging those advantages can be difficult. We’ll briefly explain the storylet-based architecture, and then illustrate one possible method for constructing such a system in Twine.

Discover how Tyler Sigman and Chris Bourassa created their own game development studio and brought their idea for Darkest Dungeon to life, as well as how they managed to develop a critically and financially successful game with the help of Kickstarter and Early Access.

The documentary also explores why the developer had to deal with an outrage after they implemented two new gameplay changes in the Early Access version. Red Hook Studios is far from done with the world they created for Darkest Dungeon and is currently working on Darkest Dungeon 2, a direct sequel that will release on Early Access first, just like the original.

Among Us is the hot new game right now - and who can blame it? It's tense, innovative and from a long tradition of games about lying to your friends, it's great. But what caused Among Us to become popular now? And what does any of that have in common with an old Russian psychology experiment from the 80s?

Fresh from another killing spree, The Architect is determined to find out why, and that's going to mean delving into murder mysteries, our modern-day political landscape, and the truth behind why we enjoy hidden role games to find out the truth behind Among Us' surprising rise to fame.

"B5mcEG10wAs","Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor (Spoilers)","Errant Signal","2023-10-14","2016-12-13","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B5mcEG10wAs/hqdefault.jpg","Correction: The developer of Cart Life is RICHARD Hofmeier, not Robert. I don't have a proofreader and am an idiot.

This is a game about cleaning up junk on a spaceport with an incinerator device.  It's also a game about poverty!  So you know it's gonna be fun.

In all seriousness: Most of my videos end in an awkwardly cliche attempt to wrap up complex or interesting arguments with a hokey summarization, but this is one of those videos where I feel like the last bit holds up better than the arguments that precede it.  The game is definitely about poverty and it definitely has something to say about the sorts of stories games tell, but it's hardly a deep treatise on the nature of the working poor or the limitations of power fantasies.  Most of it really is just an empathy piece; a game about playing someone else's life for a while - not so much in a role playing sense, but in a systemic sense.  Call it a ludic character study.  And in that sense you *feel* how difficult it is to get by with jobs that barely pay you enough to live in a way that isn't preachy to its audience or condescending to its subject.

And that experience will probably put off a lot of people, but I found  the experience really edifying.  And it probably helps that it all takes place in an adorable abstract spaceport with some cool looking aliens to boot.

Lyrics:
Hello, subject three-nine-ten.
We’ve come to test with you again.
Because there are quotas that we aren’t keeping.
We’ll never meet them if you’re left sleeping.
And if the Samba themes we beamed into your brain,
Still remain...
It’s just the sound of science.
We kept you dreaming peaceful while.
We arranged our portal tiles.
'Neath our heartless master’s watchful eye.
You’ll cheat death for us to analyse.
Or you’ll be stabbed by the spikes of a moving wall,
That crush your skull...
That’s just the sound of science.
And when you reach the exit-door,
You’ll find ten thousand chambers more.
Although we’re not sure what the data means...
You’ll face acid pits and laser beams!
As machine-guns ring and turrets sing your name,
As they take aim...
It’s just the sound of science.
Fire your portal gun in vain...
Each catwalk leads back whence you came...
Hear our words and try to understand;
We do what we must because we can!
And when you’re bested by our tests and left to fall...
...as do they all...
You heed the call of science!
One by one they bowed and prayed...
For the chocolate cake she made.
And should you reach the day your science is done...
You’ll assume the party position.
And be escorted to the room full of cake and definitely not full of flames.
But if there’s pain...
Your screams are just the sounds of science....

This is my Softbody Tetris Version V19 with some mistakes.
I still wanted to upload it so you can see what problems can arise when creating animations.
It also looks kind of interesting anyway.

The differences in brightness can arise when rendering with multiple computers if you do not take the necessary precautions.
The hair is not visible in some places. Of course, there are also many people with bald or little hair, but actually the hair should be clearly visible everywhere.
In the end there were problems with the tetromino falling down. But that looks funny.
Why did I upload it despite the errors?
I have very little time and the rendering time is huge. The next upload takes several days or weeks. All the effort would be free (even if it's my own fault). That is why I have now uploaded this version.
I hope for your understanding.
Please write it in the comments if it is ok.

Morrowind is the third entry into the main Elder Scrolls series, because we don't count Battlespire, Redguard, Dawnstar, etc.  My Morrowind review is comprehensive, including content from the plugins, addons, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon.  I also cover the game's world of Vvardenfell, Soundtrack, Transportation, Seyda Neen, Thieves Guild, Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, House Hlaalu, House Redoran, House Telvanni, the Imperial Legion, the Imperial Cult, the Morag Tong, the Tribunal Temple, and the Main Quest in this retro analysis.  I'm writing like this because search engine optimization is very important for channels my size.  This Morrowind retrospective also discusses the writing of Douglas Goodall, Ken Rolston, Michael Kirkbride, and Todd Howard.  I primarily played on the Xbox version for analytic purposes as well as the engine port OpenMW.

Now they're no longer just background NPC civilians wandering the world, they're fleshed-out characters with backstories and lives that continue on even when not in the players view.  But they can also become part of your Dedsec crew, and this requires players to dive into their personal lives to find out more about them and how they can help them with their own issues.

In this feature-length documentary episode of AI and Games, we sit down with three members of the development team and explore how 'Play as Anyone' works in Watch Dogs Legion.  We find out about the games early inspirations, the complexity of procedural character generation, how real-time mission generation wors, the numerous systems that help manage a simulated London full of NPCs and the challenges faced along the way.

"xiAVSgtIn8Q","Bloodborne • Analysis (Full Commentary).","AesirAesthetics","2023-10-14","2021-03-21","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xiAVSgtIn8Q/hqdefault.jpg","Before there was Elden Ring (and Sekiro) there was Bloodborne.
Bloodborne is a From Software game from 2015.
It's an action RPG which did a lot to prop up the PlayStation 4.
It's a spiritual sequel to Demon's Souls like Dark Souls is but where Dark Souls got a trilogy, Bloodborne got tentacle monsters!
In this video playthrough, I go through all of it and discuss & explain a range of subjects like: mechanics, visuals, gameplay, lore, development history, psychology, influences, etc.
Apologies for any repetitions (if there are any).
I went over the script and the finished walkthrough but there's always a chance that something slipped through.

Let's take a journey through time, from the beeps and bloops of the 1980's to the modern day in PLAYING GOD - a documentary covering 30 years of god simulation games. From industry legends like Peter Molyneux and Will Wright, to independent or even solo games, the God Game has been a beloved but underappreciated genre that deserves a thorough exploration.

This is my 2nd feature-length video and my longest and most ambitious production to date, so I hope you enjoy the video as much as I did making it!

Ever since the 2015 debut of Hideo Kojima's METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN, no facts about this game have been widely disseminated, only interpretations. This has to do with how the game's narrative is put together, which innovates a fusion between espionage action and forensic investigation. Is there more to TPP than meets the eye? That much is clear. But what's much harder to pin down definitively is the 'substance' behind the surface.



In this new mini-series, I try my best to piece together some idea of what's going on in the actual episodes that constitute MGSV:TPP. In this episode we look at all of Chapter Two: Race; as well as reconstruct a timeline for MGSV, and sketch out how it (may) connect back to the other games.

**************************************


""Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC on September 1, 2015.

The tenth and final main installment of the Metal Gear series, Phantom Pain follows legendary mercenary Big Boss (now known by his codename ""Venom Snake"") as he awakens in 1984 from a nine-year coma following the destruction of his private military company ""Militaires Sans Frontières"". With help from his old business partner Kazuhira Miller and rival-turned-ally Revolver Ocelot, Snake must rebuild his mercenary army (now called ""Diamond Dogs"") while plotting revenge against the shadowy organization ""Cipher,"" as well as its XOF paramilitary unit led by the enigmatic Skull Face.

Similar to its standalone prologue Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Phantom Pain focuses on executing mission objectives in open world environments set in both Soviet-occupied Afghanistan and the Angola-Zaire border region of central Africa, complete with dynamic weather and day-night systems. Stealth is a major component of gameplay, but often optional thanks to Snake's arsenal of combat gear. Players can also upgrade Diamond Dogs' new ""Mother Base"" in a fashion similar to Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, allowing them to develop new weapons and items. In addition to its single-player campaign, the game includes two player-vs-player multiplayer modes, as well as optional microtransactions and other paid downloadable content.

The Phantom Pain is notable as the final game in the series with involvement from series creator Hideo Kojima and his Kojima Productions team. Several months before the game's release, Konami began a major restructuring of its games division, ultimately leading to Kojima Productions being treated more as a contractor rather than an internal studio. Unlike prior Metal Gear titles from the same team, Kojima Productions' logo and branding is absent from promotional materials and packaging for the final game. After leaving Konami, Kojima would go on to establish a new independent studio with the same name in 2015.

The Phantom Pain was bundled together with Ground Zeroes and all DLC as Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience in late 2016 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Phantom Pain's gameplay and graphics engine were later reused for the 2018 survival-focused spin-off title Metal Gear Survive."""

"1Rqn_YtYPl0","Breath of the Wild - A Hearty Retrospective","MockRock","2023-10-14","2021-04-01","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1Rqn_YtYPl0/hqdefault.jpg","The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been one of the most influential, impactful video games released in recent years. A Breath of the Wild review or retrospective like this can be a bit of a delicate subject considering the passionate reception it's received, in communities ranging from casual Nintendo fans to the speedrunning world, but fair warning: this video isn't very delicate. It unflinchingly breaks the game apart to see where Nintendo succeeds, as well as fails, with hopes that some of its (numerous) issues can be addressed in Breath of the Wild 2. The original intention behind this video was to be released back in February, alongside the Zelda news we were undoubtedly going to be getting for the series' 35th anniversary...right? Welp, unless you really love Skyward Sword HD for $60, I think it's fair to say the lack of a Breath of the Wild sequel announcement took the wind out of a lot of peoples' sails anyways, so in retrospect, the date of this video panned out just fine. ""Breath of the Wild - A Hearty Retrospective"" marks my first step into the long form game review format, so please let me know your thoughts on what went right and wrong, and enjoy!

I will be re-recording this into batches I think at some point to make it easier to do and upload. This will give me the time to properly talk about each class as much as I would like, since even though this video is only 5 hours long it was actually brutal on my throat. Eventually I would like to see 5 or 6 videos of 10 hours of footage uploaded. We'll see how long it takes. Thanks for watching friends.

All cleric mage and thief kits are about the same for dual classing so if you're an assassin or bounty hunter and are dual classing into a fighter, I don't think it merits a tier difference.

It's now been over a decade since Hideo Kojima's towering, if controversial, METAL GEAR SOLID 4: GUNS OF THE PATRIOTS (2008). How has the game held up? What was it really all about, and why was it made this way? This, as long as it is,  is just one possible explanation.

""You have been given freedom. Freedom to be...Outside. You are nobody's tool now... No one's toy. You are no longer a prisoner of fate. You are no longer a seed of war. It's time for you to see the outside world with your own eyes. Your body... And your soul... Are your own. Forget about us. Live... For yourself. And find... A new lease on life. Boss... You only need one snake. No... The world would be better off without snakes. This is good... Isn't it?""
-JD


Basically there are 3 Acts, with only the first Act segmented into explicit Parts. This, I thought up to unconsciously recall to mind the growth from childhood to old age, as being young feels like it takes so much longer!

0:00 - Introduction

2:32 - ACT ONE: CHILD STAGE
01:19:44 - ACT TWO: ADULT STAGE
01:53:44 - ACT THREE: OLD STAGE

************

Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots takes place in 2014, around 5 years after the events of MGS2, and sees an aged Solid Snake (now dubbed 'Old Snake') on his final mission to stop Liquid Ocelot and his PMC armies once and for all. It was intended as the conclusion of the Metal Gear Solid story, a fact that was played up throughout the game's marketing - most trailers showed Snake seemingly committing suicide at the conclusion of his mission.

While serving as a direct narrative sequel to MGS2, most gameplay elements from MGS3 such as the 3D camera, CQC, and camouflage return, along with new features and a variety of new settings including active battlefields. A new Metal Gear Online game was included on the MGS4 disc (before later getting a standalone retail release in Japan), but was shut down on June 12, 2012.

The game was released exclusively on PlayStation 3 on June 12, 2008 and unlike other numbered MGS entries, has not received an updated release (á la Integral, Substance or Subsistence), nor a release on any other platform. Retail discs available from August 2012 are updated with the 2.0 patch.

Metal Gear Solid 4 Database was released free of charge on the PlayStation Store just after MGS4's release. It's a companion application that serves as a guide to the complete Metal Gear canon up to the release of MGS4, with spoilers for that game locked until a completed MGS4 save is detected. MGS4 was shown running on PlayStation Vita hardware at a pre-launch press conference in Japan (specifically the scene from the original gameplay trailer, with Snake and Mk. II). No indication has been given that a full Vita version was ever being developed, though a (much) more primitive handheld adaptation was released on iOS as Metal Gear Solid Touch.

No, the Scout from Team Fortress 2 is not a pick class. Stop saying he is.
Scout can get picks, but that doesn't make him a pick class. So despite how it might seem really obvious to suggest that he is one, it's not quite as simple as that.

Trying to classify different characters, playstyles, or archetypes in videogames is a tale as old as time. World of Warcraft pioneered the standard that so many games use nowadays of tank, dps and support. Every character fell into one of these categories, and it worked so well that many modern games use the same formula.

You've got your Tanks, your healers, and your damage dealers.

But team fortress 2's classes really don't fall into this category well. Medic is a support, so is engineer, I guess, but that's about as close to fitting anyone into this holy trinity as you're going to get.

The classification the tf2 community came up with is a whole lot more broad. Instead of basing it on what their role in the team is, it's instead based on how generally applicable to any situation the classes are.

We've got generalists, and specialists.

Team fortress 2 is an unusual game.

It's a game that without question has stood the test of time. And its success is owed entirely to the clever design decisions made by the developers of the game. Tf2 has some of the weirdest, most counter intuitive, and downright stupid design decisions I've ever seen in any videogame. It's one of my favourite games of all time, and is my most played game by a long shot, but yet it has some of the worst design choices I've ever come across.

And no amount of random crits or bad map design could possibly be worse.

Than the existence of the sniper...

FOOTNOTE: Someone claiming to have co-authored one of the pro-gamergate blogs I pulled from Running With Scissor's tumblr feels it was misused and clarified its intent in the comments:
""When I wrote ""truly great games, that are obviously made with a lot of heart and passion, go unnoticed and left behind in favour of shoddy games that don't seem nearly as deserving of the attention"", I was not at all referring to the Postal series. It would be non-sensical if I did, because among its target audience, I believe Postal has done quite well for itself. You are right that Postal has niche appeal, and for a niche product I think it has been quite successful. Besides, as I am not an employee of RWS, and receive no monetary reward for that article, or for sales of any Postal title, I had no reason to express resent over the success or failure of Postal as a product. I wrote the article to express exactly what is written - support of gamers, and game makers, who have either gone unnoticed or antagonized by the gaming press. I know I am treading on ground where you might disagree with that, but it is sincerely where I was coming from.

There are many other inaccuracies among the claims you make, that I would have liked to tackle, but I'm not a member of RWS and I am confident that they can stand up for themselves. So I'm only here to address the instance where you used my words specifically, to paint an inaccurate picture of RWS, as being sore that (using your stated interpretation of my article) Postal isn't as successful as Depression Quest (which is obviously a ridiculous assertion, but that's what I got from your statements. Please let me know if I misinterpreted). This should be an easy fix, with a simple annotation during that segment of your video, explaining that my article isn't actually saying what you're claiming that it is. It wouldn't be too much trouble, I believe, and I would appreciate that greatly.""

It's like an audio book-- choose a chapter and watch as much or as little as you like.

Note to Subscribers: I know a lot of you have asked me to make a complete retrospective for the Elder Scrolls series, but I just couldn't do it. This video as it stands  took me four months to play through the games, write the script, and do the recording. I did consider doing a total Elder Scrolls vs. Dragon Age video-- but as soon as I began Oblivion after spending 110 hours on Skyrim, I knew it wasn't going to happen. I hope you enjoy this video anyway,"

It looks at the arc of development from 1998-2020 that took Gordon Freeman from the popularizer of mouselook to the herald of virtual reality. It also covers Half-Life associated and adjacent games, like Portal 1 and 2, Source Multiplayer titles, and some iconic single-player mods. This is a remake of a video I'd done in 2013. That video has now been delisted in favor of this updated, tidier edition. A link to it has been provided below for anyone still curious, as well as download links for mods. Again, spoilers throughout.

Over the course of five hours, the video tries to figure out how the games support or detract from one another, the ways they're connected, and how a clumsy fool like me can find not only victory but comfort in their strange, sad little worlds.

The team behind Wayward Strand have created an intricately detailed real-time narrative adventure where all the NPCs are just as busy as the player. In this 2023 Independent Games Summit talk, narrative co-directors Georgia Symons and Jason Bakker talk about their process for structuring a world of simultaneous stories in a way that feels nourishing to the player.

Games have been messing with morality for ages - but are karma systems and binary choices the best we can do? Inspired by Darkest Dungeon's neat twist on video game villainy, let's look at some indie games that make morality a central component of their design.

Stealth bosses are incredibly difficult to get right and there are few good examples. However, Rocksteady went above and beyond by turning the fantastic stealth system in Batman Arkham City into a full fledged boss fight. The Arkham series has always had incredible stealth combat and Mr. Freeze turns that system into the best stealth boss fight of all time. On this episode of Finest Fights, we take a deep dive on Freeze, and explore what makes him so special.

Consumable items have always had an awkward place in video games. Should you save them for when you need them most or use them when they are useful? And how will you even know when you need them most? This leads to an endless cycle of item hoarding where you never end up using your coolest and most powerful items. Gothic 2 flips this problem on its head by introducing a system of hints and rewards that gets players to stop hoarding, and start using their items in creative ways. Its a great solution to this problem that more games could learn from.

On June 28th 2023 - Harrison Ford will embark on his last adventure as Indiana Jones in THE DIAL OF DESTINY, finally bringing an end to a cinematic legacy that spans three decades - but does that mean the end of Indiana Jones?

Today we'll be exploring the wild world of Indiana Jones video games and tracing it's history from it's early days in the arcade through to it's death on the Xbox and PlayStation. Along the way we'll cover everything from Monkey Island to Star Wars, Tomb Raider to Uncharted, The NES to the Nintendo 64 - all in hopes of discovering what the future could hold for Henry Jones Junior.

It's part critique, part retrospective, part review and part history lesson - obviously full of spoilers and obviously full of my opinions.

Update: After some requests, I have uploaded a recommended starter config for controllers!
This config was created using a Dualsense controller, but it may work on other controllers too. It assumes you're using the default keyboard keys, and a mouse sensitivity of ""2"".
If you want to give a gyro controller a go today, use this link and assuming your TF2 settings match what I said, you'll immediately have Flick Stick and gyro ready, along with some radial menu shortcuts!

steam://controllerconfig/440/2801222110

MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT USING -NOJOY AND -NOSTEAMCONTROLLER IN LAUNCH OPTIONS K THANKS

CONTROLS:
Left stick to move, right stick is Flick Stick.
Hold Square to pause the gyro (or if you're in the menu, it's the opposite, hold to enable)
Weapon keys are bound to the rest of the face buttons (1, 2, 3 buttons)

Dpad UP is your build or disguise key.
Dpad left is meant for an undisguise key for Spy. However, TF2 does not have this bind by default, you need to bind it yourself.
Dpad right is ""Reload"", for weapons like the Hitman's Heatmaker.
Dpad Down is ""Last disguise"" for Spy (B)

While a disguise or taunt menu is open, use the touchpad to select number keys 0-9. You can also use the dpad like normal, but the touchpad should be faster.

During regular gameplay, the left side of the touchpad lets you vote, or make a new vote. The right side of the touchpad lets you change class, change loadout, or change team. If your controller does not have a touchpad, you will need to make manual changes to add these functions elsewhere.

While waiting on a respawn, left stick lets you look around while right stick still uses flick stick. For consistency, I suppose. MvM fast respawn button should be present and working.

Due to the very long nature of this video, and the sheer number of facts, here are a few known mistakes I didn't manage to catch before uploading:
• Splendid Screen's bonus bash damage stat was incorrectly labelled as +80% instead of +70%
• Normal air accel cap is apparently 30 hu/s regardless of your base movement speed.
• According to the TF Wiki, Heavy apparently takes 50% less knockback, rather than 75% less.

Since you cared enough to scroll down, may I interest you in a story?

This video will undoubtedly be the one to push me past 200k subscribers, so I want to use this opportunity to say ""thank you"". Not just for the support, but for being patient with how slow I am.

My slow upload schedule over the past few years can mainly be attributed to this video, or rather, what came before it. I spent a lot of time trying to make an in-depth video about the Tide Turner, TF2's most interesting weapon. But I ran into many snags. Namely, the video was too ambitious.

The goal was:
1. Make a Tide Turner weapon review
2. Include a charging/trimping tutorial (uh oh)
3. Somehow do this while keeping focus on the Tide Turner specifically (uh oh)
4. Deep dive into the history of charge turning, the exploits, etc. (uh oh)

My old PC wasn't up for the task. Constant crashes were inevitable, even after splitting the project into TEN different files.

I ended up dumping many months into something that would never get finished. While a heatwave was cooking me, I got frustrated, and started working on something else. This resulted in the controller video I uploaded around this time last year.

As if things couldn't get any worse, the fan in my GPU started dying and I used this as an excuse to finally get a new rig, in the hopes of making longer projects actually feasible. It clearly worked, but this now meant I had to move the project and all of its files to the new PC. Not very fun.

After ""Demoknight TF2 RETURNS"" served its role as a test for what this new PC could do, I made the difficult decision to scrap the Tide Turner video, at least for now. Instead, a more reasonable goal was set: Make a video about JUST charging, and re-use as many assets from the unfinished video as possible. It still ended up being 1 hour long. The majority of gameplay was still recorded on the new PC, because it can run the game on much higher settings. But things like ""mafs with Solar"" were originally intended for a Tide Turner video.

If I ever decide to revisit the idea of a Tide Turner video in the future, it will be toned down. I will do my best to restore more unused SFM assets and jokes, but with the subject of charging finally covered, I don't have to include a whole charging guide with my weapon review anymore. And to be honest, it's probably better this way, since I was able to give the charging mechanic proper justice. There's still some things unaccounted for, but I got most of it!

Evidently, I'm a perfectionist, to a fault. I only want to make videos that I would actually want to watch. I'd rather upload nothing, than upload something disappointing or lackluster. Sometimes, this means spending months on a video, only for it to get scrapped. Sometimes, it means turning those past failures into a 1 hour, visually entertaining tutorial. Sometimes, it means repurposing cut content for a short meme upload, but not often.

Thank you for watching and reading. Praise the sun. Next time, it might be about a so-called scimitar. (Edit: No, it wasn't.)"

Roleplaying is something I really enjoy doing in games like Dungeons and Dragons, and I feel like it should be something I enjoy in video games as well, but it always seems to fall short. This video takes a look at some of the barriers that get in the way of good roleplaying in video games along with me trying to overcome those barriers.

You ever wish you could erase your memory for the sole purpose of being able to replay certain games again for the first time? Yeah? Thought so. For me, I would give almost anything to play Breath of the Wild, Shadow of the Colossus, and Outer Wilds again for the first time again. The bigger issue is that I barely even feel like I can replay these games at all, despite them being three of my favorites of all time. So, in this video, I dive into why these games don't feel replayable to me, and pour one out for the games I wish I could play again for the first time.

It's moody and monochromatic and maybe a little sacrilegious.  Also you can steal cookies from people you're torturing, so that's a plus.

Let's talk about the two DLC missions that come as part of Hitman 2's expansion pass—The Bank and Haven Island—and see how they play to Hitman 2's already impressive strengths, while also laying the groundwork for the potential future of the series.

In this video, I'm talking about how this game managed to be the first video game that gave me the feeling of playing a tabletop campaign with an actual DM. And many other shenanigans.

Crafting systems are one of the most popular mechanics in all of videogaming, appearing in everything from open world games to shooters to MMOs, and if there's one thing that most crafting systems have in common it's the fact that they... sort of suck.Whether they're boring or time consuming or overly simplistic, there are a lot of potential problems that can plague crafting systems, and to make matters worse - a lot of the bad ones look just like the good ones.

So, what’s the solution?

Well, after some tinkering, salvaging and refining, The Architect has come up with a three-step formula to fixing every crafting system, focusing not on their mechanics, or their balance, but the way they affect their parent games - it makes sense in context, trust me."

CoffeeNutGaming is a part-time twitch streamer and full-time video game fan who started gaming at the age of five and developed a passion for the art when he encountered his first role playing game at the age of seven. On that faithful day, he got stuck inside the Census Office in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind while gaming with his brother in their parent's basement, and a way of life was forged. Since then, he has grown into an obsessive caffeine addict, and a stickler for the finer things in all made-up fantasy worlds and gaming universes.

It has a well-crafted world, an interesting premise, and a core gameplay loop that really hasn't been seen any time since this released over 20 years ago. The game sold rather poorly at launch, and it didn't get very good reviews either. While Diggles has an EXTREMELY innovative premise and style of gameplay, it ultimately failed to execute on this is almost every way besides presentation. The game is riddled with bugs, crashes, and even when it is working properly, it still falls flat. Everything is far too slow, and the AI and pathfinding systems are so dysfunctional that the game could be considered as having released in an unfinished state.

Next time someone says that unfinished, broken new releases are a new problem of the 2020s, just show them Diggles. It's always been a problem, it's just that these unfinished games get far more media coverage today than they did back in the pre-social media era.

Here are both parts of my retrospective / playthrough / musings on this, one of the greatest tactical RPGs ever made.  Have coffee and muffin, a beer and a sammich, and enjoy this very long, somewhat rough first FULL long form retrospective I've made. Audio issues and editing aside, the next video will be more ""professional"" looking and sounding. Anyway, thanks for watching!

A large portion of the ideas and themes I express are based off of the literary work done by Yuval Noah Harari. Things like the critiques of capitalism, or the ideas of happiness and how we perceive it.

In particular, I would highly recommend reading ""Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind""."

DISCORD - https://discord.gg/pYEXBk3d

Samus Aran and her battle against the Metroids form one of Nintendo's most iconic series - a franchise that has seen 17 releases throughout the company's storied history - a beloved mainstay of everything from Gameboy to Super Nintendo, GameCube to Switch.

And yet - for all its critical acclaim and longevity - it exists in the shadow of its siblings - never finding the financial success enjoyed by Mario, Zelda or Pokémon and often disappearing into painful hibernation.

Today we're going to be exploring this contradiction. How can a series run for four decades, define genres and platforms and yet constantly be on the cusp of extinction?

It's part critique, part retrospective, part review and part history lesson - obviously full of spoilers and obviously full of my opinions
