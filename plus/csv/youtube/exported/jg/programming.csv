"yXZ5DH7cSgM","2B. Type State Pattern - From Python to Rust","Bedroom Builds","2023-10-14","2022-04-16","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yXZ5DH7cSgM/hqdefault.jpg","Type state pattern, allows writing APIs that are validating their correct use at compile-time:

- Require a function to be always called
- Enforce order of function calls
- Forbid a function to be called twice
- Mutually exclusive function calls

"R4w-ITMOOBY","Scalapeño 2016 - Extensible Effects vs. Monad Transformers (Shimi Bandiel)","Underscore","2023-10-14","2016-07-10","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R4w-ITMOOBY/hqdefault.jpg","Monads are an important abstraction in functional programming. However, they do not compose.
In this session we'll compare the two prevalent ways of ""composing"" monads: Monad Transformers and Extensible Effects.

We won't cover the implementation details of these techniques, but will instead focus on the user side and see how your code can benefit from these abstractions, as well as their relative advantages and disadvantages."
"Sp9ZfSvpf7A","Inspecting the CSS Cascade using Firefox DevTools","Mozilla Developer","2023-10-14","2019-12-04","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sp9ZfSvpf7A/hqdefault.jpg","The Cascade is a central feature of CSS, and a common source of confusion. With styles coming from multiple selectors and style sheets, the cascade determines which styles take priority: overriding other styles. There are several factors in play, so we can easily get lost wondering why a style isn't being applied, where a style is coming from, or why one rule overrides another. The Firefox DevTools can help so we know what we're looking at. Miriam Suzanne will show you how the cascade is represented in the inspector, and how to get the most out of these tools – from debugging code to writing and manipulating the cascade directly in the browser.

"aHUtMbJw8iA","Why Is CSS So Weird?","Mozilla Developer","2023-10-14","2019-10-02","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aHUtMbJw8iA/hqdefault.jpg","Love it or hate it, CSS is weird! It doesn't work like most programming languages, and it doesn't work like a design tool either. But CSS is also solving a very weird and unique problem: What does it mean to ""design"" in a medium that is appears on everything from tablets, laptops, and TVs to braille readers, watches, and headphones?

As the web becomes more powerful and complex, it's important to ask: how did we get here, and where are we headed?

"h3MgTin77wY","Coding From Scratch! #013 - Falling Sand Simulation","Stray Basilisk","2023-10-14","2020-09-07","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3MgTin77wY/hqdefault.jpg","In this stream we coded a falling sand simulation with flowing water, sand, gasoline and fire effects. You can place down the materials with the mouse, and play around with them as they react according to a simple cellular automata / physics simulation. The code is quite simple, but it produces some really neat effects, and is quite satisfying to play around with.

We walk through the whole thought process and programming required. So jump in, and follow along!

This is a series where we do live video game development, walking through all of the concepts, math, and code along the way.
