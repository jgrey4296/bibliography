It talks about how games can present zombies in ways that are unique from comics, movies, and television. And there's a ton of spoilers, especially for The Walking Dead.

"kivtv6wabBk","Postal, Hatred, and Weighing the Worth of Asshole Simulators","Noah Caldwell-Gervais","2015-12-08","2015-11-09","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kivtv6wabBk/hqdefault.jpg","This video is an in-depth critical deconstruction of the Postal franchise from Running With Scissors as well as Hatred from Destructive Creations. It looks at the deliberate jackassery that defines the player experience in these games and considers the merit of the games from a mechanical, cultural, and personal level.

Content warning for gamified sexual assault, a lot of cock and balls stuff, and a whole heap of racism and sexism.

FOOTNOTE: Someone claiming to have co-authored one of the pro-gamergate blogs I pulled from Running With Scissor's tumblr feels it was misused and clarified its intent in the comments:
""When I wrote ""truly great games, that are obviously made with a lot of heart and passion, go unnoticed and left behind in favour of shoddy games that don't seem nearly as deserving of the attention"", I was not at all referring to the Postal series. It would be non-sensical if I did, because among its target audience, I believe Postal has done quite well for itself. You are right that Postal has niche appeal, and for a niche product I think it has been quite successful. Besides, as I am not an employee of RWS, and receive no monetary reward for that article, or for sales of any Postal title, I had no reason to express resent over the success or failure of Postal as a product. I wrote the article to express exactly what is written - support of gamers, and game makers, who have either gone unnoticed or antagonized by the gaming press. I know I am treading on ground where you might disagree with that, but it is sincerely where I was coming from.

There are many other inaccuracies among the claims you make, that I would have liked to tackle, but I'm not a member of RWS and I am confident that they can stand up for themselves. So I'm only here to address the instance where you used my words specifically, to paint an inaccurate picture of RWS, as being sore that (using your stated interpretation of my article) Postal isn't as successful as Depression Quest (which is obviously a ridiculous assertion, but that's what I got from your statements. Please let me know if I misinterpreted). This should be an easy fix, with a simple annotation during that segment of your video, explaining that my article isn't actually saying what you're claiming that it is. It wouldn't be too much trouble, I believe, and I would appreciate that greatly.""
