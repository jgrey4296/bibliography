"kMPDx68Lgkc","LGWI - King of Dragon Pass: The Sad Tale of Clan Cybrixia","Grimith","2012-03-03","2012-03-01","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kMPDx68Lgkc/hqdefault.jpg","I nearly lost this video; in a very rare turn of events, Camtasia Studio 7 crashed while saving the file. While I managed to recover the entire video as well as my own audio track, all of the game audio is corrupted and beyond repair. I apologize for the inconvenience. Obviously, my Windows Vista clunker - on which I recorded this video - is upset over me getting a new computer. I'll have to smother it with huggles and rainbow kisses to prevent the problem from occurring again.

There are other reasons why this is a sad tale, but I won't spoil them. Discover for yourself the rise and fall of Clan Cybrixia."

No, no, there's no need to answer that; it was a rhetorical question. Just so long as I keep my sanity, everything will be okay."

In other words: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?

I won't spoil what happens, but let's just say I got so distracted, I forgot I had invested two magic points into doing a Heroquest this year."

Hope you folks enjoyed the show. It probably didn't end the way you wanted... but, well, it didn't end the way I wanted either, so at least you're not alone. Not everyone gets to spend quality time with me, you know? Truly, you should feel honored!"
