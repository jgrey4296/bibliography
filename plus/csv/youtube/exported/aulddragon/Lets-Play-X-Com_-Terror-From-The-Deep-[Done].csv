First of all, sorry for the INCREDIBLY annoying audio glitch; the only way to fix it is to quit the game and load a save, which can't be done on the final level of T'Leth. It was the worst time for it to afflict my recording.

The Ultimate Destruction of the alien menace is at hand. Join me in unleashing explosive doom upon them all!

After this, we have some Let's Fail episodes from MUCH earlier in the game's progress before we get to any new games. Should be fun!"
