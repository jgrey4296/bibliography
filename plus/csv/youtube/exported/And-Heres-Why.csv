"mLJ1gyIzg78","Fallout 3 Is Garbage, And Here's Why","hbomberguy","2019-12-11","2016-05-13","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mLJ1gyIzg78/hqdefault.jpg","This is a review of Fallout 3, featuring retrospectives on the series as a whole, analysis of gameplay and storytelling mechanics, discussion of the games' initial critical reception, and the ability to absorb 1.5 hours of your human life right through the screen.

It is also feature-length. Literally the length of numerous good films you could watch instead. Oops!

Oh and also let's commit to me destroying my entire life for charity trying to play all of donkey kong 64 in one sitting. Uh oh. Why did I do this

I've gotta change my avatar I actually really don't like bananas. Maybe I hate them because of this game. Or maybe it's because one time I ate some rotten pizza and it tasted just enough like banana that I gag. Lol I wrote all all of this and you read it. The internet is a miracle.
