Game Description:

Title: Tyranny
Genre: Adventure, RPG
Developer: Obsidian Entertainment
Publisher: Paradox Interactive
Release Date: Nov 10, 2016

In Tyranny, the grand war between good and evil is over – and the forces of evil, led by Kyros the Overlord, have won. The Overlord’s merciless armies dominate the face of the world, and its denizens must find their new roles within the war-torn realm... even as discord begins to rumble among the ranks of Kyros’ most powerful Archons.

Players will experience the new world order under the Overlord in a reactive role-playing game (RPG), interacting with the populace as a powerful Fatebinder in the Overlord’s forces -- roaming the lands to inspire loyalty or fear as they bring control to the last holdouts of the Tiers.

Main Features:

Branching, unique stories in an original setting: The battle between good and evil has already taken place, and evil stands victorious

Choices matter –  make world-altering decisions with far-reaching consequence: As a Fatebinder in the Overlord’s army you wield a vast amount of power in the occupied lands of the Tiers. Will you use that to inspire stability and loyalty, will you be feared, or will you seek your own power?

Challenging, classic RPG combat: Tactical real-time-with-pause combat with new party-driven mechanics and modern presentation

A rich original setting: Not just another “hero’s journey” -- Tyranny turns the archetypal RPG story on its head and allows players to explore a new take on good and evil

ARCHON EDITION & OVERLORD EDITION

The Overlord’s merciless armies dominate the face of the world, and its denizens must find their new roles within the war-torn realm... even as discord begins to rumble among the ranks of Kyros’ most powerful Archons.

Players will experience the new world order under the Overlord in a reactive role-playing game (RPG), interacting with the populace as a powerful Fatebinder in the Overlord’s forces -- roaming the lands to inspire loyalty or fear as they bring control to the last holdouts of the Tiers.

Main Features:

Branching, unique stories in an original setting: The battle between good and evil has already taken place, and evil stands victorious

Choices matter –  make world-altering decisions with far-reaching consequence: As a Fatebinder in the Overlord’s army you wield a vast amount of power in the occupied lands of the Tiers. Will you use that to inspire stability and loyalty, will you be feared, or will you seek your own power?

Challenging, classic RPG combat: Tactical real-time-with-pause combat with new party-driven mechanics and modern presentation

A rich original setting: Not just another “hero’s journey” -- Tyranny turns the archetypal RPG story on its head and allows players to explore a new take on good and evil

Game Description:

Title: Tyranny
Genre: Adventure, RPG
Developer: Obsidian Entertainment
Publisher: Paradox Interactive
Release Date: Nov 10, 2016

In Tyranny, the grand war between good and evil is over – and the forces of evil, led by Kyros the Overlord, have won. The Overlord’s merciless armies dominate the face of the world, and its denizens must find their new roles within the war-torn realm... even as discord begins to rumble among the ranks of Kyros’ most powerful Archons.

Players will experience the new world order under the Overlord in a reactive role-playing game (RPG), interacting with the populace as a powerful Fatebinder in the Overlord’s forces -- roaming the lands to inspire loyalty or fear as they bring control to the last holdouts of the Tiers.

Main Features:

Branching, unique stories in an original setting: The battle between good and evil has already taken place, and evil stands victorious

Choices matter –  make world-altering decisions with far-reaching consequence: As a Fatebinder in the Overlord’s army you wield a vast amount of power in the occupied lands of the Tiers. Will you use that to inspire stability and loyalty, will you be feared, or will you seek your own power?

Challenging, classic RPG combat: Tactical real-time-with-pause combat with new party-driven mechanics and modern presentation

A rich original setting: Not just another “hero’s journey” -- Tyranny turns the archetypal RPG story on its head and allows players to explore a new take on good and evil

ARCHON EDITION & OVERLORD EDITION

Main Features:

Branching, unique stories in an original setting: The battle between good and evil has already taken place, and evil stands victorious

Choices matter –  make world-altering decisions with far-reaching consequence: As a Fatebinder in the Overlord’s army you wield a vast amount of power in the occupied lands of the Tiers. Will you use that to inspire stability and loyalty, will you be feared, or will you seek your own power?

Challenging, classic RPG combat: Tactical real-time-with-pause combat with new party-driven mechanics and modern presentation

A rich original setting: Not just another “hero’s journey” -- Tyranny turns the archetypal RPG story on its head and allows players to explore a new take on good and evil

Game Description:

Title: Tyranny
Genre: Adventure, RPG
Developer: Obsidian Entertainment
Publisher: Paradox Interactive
Release Date: Nov 10, 2016

In Tyranny, the grand war between good and evil is over – and the forces of evil, led by Kyros the Overlord, have won. The Overlord’s merciless armies dominate the face of the world, and its denizens must find their new roles within the war-torn realm... even as discord begins to rumble among the ranks of Kyros’ most powerful Archons.

Players will experience the new world order under the Overlord in a reactive role-playing game (RPG), interacting with the populace as a powerful Fatebinder in the Overlord’s forces -- roaming the lands to inspire loyalty or fear as they bring control to the last holdouts of the Tiers.

Game Description:

Title: Tyranny
Genre: Adventure, RPG
Developer: Obsidian Entertainment
Publisher: Paradox Interactive
Release Date: Nov 10, 2016

In Tyranny, the grand war between good and evil is over – and the forces of evil, led by Kyros the Overlord, have won. The Overlord’s merciless armies dominate the face of the world, and its denizens must find their new roles within the war-torn realm... even as discord begins to rumble among the ranks of Kyros’ most powerful Archons.

Players will experience the new world order under the Overlord in a reactive role-playing game (RPG), interacting with the populace as a powerful Fatebinder in the Overlord’s forces -- roaming the lands to inspire loyalty or fear as they bring control to the last holdouts of the Tiers.

Main Features:

Branching, unique stories in an original setting: The battle between good and evil has already taken place, and evil stands victorious

Choices matter –  make world-altering decisions with far-reaching consequence: As a Fatebinder in the Overlord’s army you wield a vast amount of power in the occupied lands of the Tiers. Will you use that to inspire stability and loyalty, will you be feared, or will you seek your own power?

Challenging, classic RPG combat: Tactical real-time-with-pause combat with new party-driven mechanics and modern presentation

A rich original setting: Not just another “hero’s journey” -- Tyranny turns the archetypal RPG story on its head and allows players to explore a new take on good and evil

ARCHON EDITION & OVERLORD EDITION
