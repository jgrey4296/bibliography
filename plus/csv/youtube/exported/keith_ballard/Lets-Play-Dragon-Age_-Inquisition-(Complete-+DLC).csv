Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen.

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen.

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern.

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern.

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern.

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern.

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern.
