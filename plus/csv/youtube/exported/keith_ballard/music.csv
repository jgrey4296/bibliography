Lyrics:

VERSE 1
It’s my first night out with you
Treat me right and buy me shoes
Let me be your fantasy - play with me
I wanna be your girl

BRIDGE
Just give me some time
I will be ready
Do my make-up
Bathe in my perfume
Quick shower
Won’t take too long
I’ll be done just sing this song

CHORUS
Wrap me in plastic
And make me shine
We can make a dollhouse
Follow your design
Let’s build a dog
Out of sticks and twine
I can call you master
You can call be mine

VERSE 2
Move me tell me what to do
If you’re happy, I am too
Please just show me what you like - don’t be shy
I wanna be your girl

Lyric:
Her knees, feet and elbow
Work their thing into a mamba
The scene starts to crumble
To the sound of the drums
Oh boy, there ain't no need to buy that diamond ring
It ain't no big thing, just show her a little swing
No care about the bling bling bro
There ain't nothing to do
Oh man soon it's over and you'll
Sing the walking blues
So boy, there ain't no need to buy that diamond ring
It ain't no big thing, just show her a little swing
When you're up
When you're down
And there ain't no love around
There's a place
For you my friend
There's a way
For you my friend
Just show her some swing
It ain't no big thing, just show her a little swing"

It took 3 times as much trial and error to make with 3 riders.

Huge thanks to David/Conundrumer. He's the software guy who made it possible for me to use multiple riders.

Also here is his channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheConundrumer

It gets a bit crazy to keep track of all the riders at once, but I love chaos ;) Hope you enjoy!

Lyrics:
Join in my
Join in my child
And listen, digging through
My old numb shadow

My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking scabs again
I'm down, digging through
My old muscles looking for a clue

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in
I want to feel the changes coming down
I want to know what I've been hiding

In my shadow
My shadow
Change is coming through my shadow
My shadow
Shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again

Join in my
Join in my child
My shadow's
Closer to meaning

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
Insecure delusions
I wanna feel the change consume me
Feel the outside turning in
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured in

My shadow
My shadow
Change is coming
Now is my time
Listen to my muscle memory
Contemplate what I've been clinging to
Forty six and two ahead of me

I choose to live and to
Grow, take and give and to
Move, learn and love and to
Cry, kill and die and to
Be paranoid and to
Lie, hate and fear and to
Do what it takes to move through

I choose to live and to
Lie, kill and give and to
Die, learn and love and to
Do what it takes to step through

See my shadow changing
Stretching up and over me
Soften this old armor
Hoping I can clear the way by
Stepping through my shadow
Coming out the other side
Step into the shadow
Forty six and two are just ahead of me"

Lyrics:
There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea.
You became the light on the dark side of me.
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill.
But did you know,
That when it snows,
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can be seen.
Baby,
I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
Ooh,
The more I get of you,
The stranger it feels, yeah.
And now that your rose is in bloom.
A light hits the gloom on the gray.
There is so much a man can tell you,
So much he can say.
You remain,
My power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny.
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?
But did you know,
That when it snows,
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.
Baby,
I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
Ooh, the more I get of you
The stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom.
A light hits the gloom on the gray,
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray,
I've been kissed by a rose
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray,
...And if I should fall along the way
I've been kissed by a rose
...been kissed by a rose on the gray.
There is so much a man can tell you,
So much he can say.
You remain
My power, my pleasure, my pain.
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby.
But did you know,
That when it snows,
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.
Baby,
I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
Ooh, the more I get of you
The stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray.
Yes I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you
The stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray."

*1 Pilgrimage was not performed, but rather played over the PA as an intro in 2007 on multiple dates. I went ahead and included the audio for album flow

*2 Metal was subbed in for Where Is Everybody? because WIE has never been played, but Metal was Fragile-Era

*3 Starfuckers, Inc. was a weird one, I’ll admit. I couldn’t rip the video from my AATCHB DVD because my disc 2 was too scratched up (in any case, I wanted to break away from using so much “official” Fragile-Era footage). So I used Big Day Out 2000 and Corona Capital 2018 footage instead. It’s a little shaky in places but it’s functional

*4 Audio captured from a 2018 IEM feed. I wasn’t able to find footage of that speech so I used placeholder intro footage. Not ideal, but again functional

*5 This is my favorite version of The Fragile. Performed at Bridge School Benefit 2006/07 I think. I couldn’t leave it out of this. Sadly the footage is pretty boring, but I kept it anyway

*6 Subbed this song in because it was Fragile-era and The New Flesh hasn’t ever been properly performed

*7 See above but for Underneath It All

*8 again with the not having actual footage of this speech

*9 This isn’t *technically* fragile era. Closer to TDS (kinda between the two, though the performance is from 2018) but it fit the vibe perfectly and is a great closer!

Gotta love Propane nightmares. Awesome song. Happened that I was messing around with bots when I first heard it and the thought of making this vid just popped into place.

Sorry, I'm not going to explain how it works, stop asking. =P

If you're wondering how long this took me, I'd wager around three weeks of working on it on and off. It didn't actually take that long, working on the movie and the scripts was quite enjoyable.

About the donation request at the end: Manta Engie is paid for out of my pocket right now, and I'd like it if became self-sufficient. What I'm saying is that it's unlikely that I will ask for donations again as all donations go towards maintaining the site.

It's got to be the end
With you

I told you time and time again
You told me he was just a friend
But I found out some way
I've seen him every day
With you

'Cause you never treat me tenderly
You got no reason for leaving me
'Cause I can't leave you alone
'Cause I knew from the start
You'd be tearing me apart
Sooner or later

'Cause you never treat me tenderly
You got no reason for leaving me
'Cause I can't leave you alone

"mO-OpFjHRbE","""A SONG ABOUT BIRDS""","Van Vuuren Bros","2021-10-28","2017-01-11","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mO-OpFjHRbE/hqdefault.jpg","This song is a tribute to the glorious creatures of the bird kingdom.
Written and Performed by Christiaan Van Vuuren (@ChristiaanVanV)
Recorded and Mixed by Damien Enemark at Song Zu.

LYRICS BELOW:

The woodpecker bird, likes pecking wood,
The Bluebird’s a bird, that sings pretty good.
Sparrows are a bird that are pretty cool, ay.
But the ibis is a bird that drinks bin-juice all day.

A crow is a bird with a really cool squawk,
A cockatoo’s a bird with a sick Mohawk,
The chicken is a bird that tastes good and lays eggs,
But Ibis’s, are bin-juice drinking dregs!

A goose is a bird that’s chilled like a duck.
An ibis is a bird that’s a picnic-wrecking fuck!
Doves are birds that represent purity.
Ibis’s wreck picnics and disrupt the community.

Penguins are birds that fall in love and mate for life,
BUT IBIS’S LOVE NOTHING CAUSE THEY’RE DEAD INSIDE!
A Swan is a bird that’s graceful and that.
And Ibis’s aren’t birds, they’re feathered bin-rats.

It's the ibis (ibis) bin-juice drinking gronk.
Yeah the ibis (ibis) they’re beaks are gross and long.
It's the ibis (ibis!) Picnic wrecking jerk.
It’s the ibis (ibis) they’re the worst bird.

The condor is an awesome bird of prey,
A hawk’s a bird that’s a cool bird ay.
The eagle bird soars through the sky as it hunts,
But ibis's are bin-juice drinking cunts.

The albatross bird lives to 60, maybe older.
A parrot is a bird living on a pirate’s shoulder,
Parrots say cool shit like ""polly wanna cracker"".
But Ibis’s just fucken come up and harass ya.

A lorikeet is a bird, with a colourful jacket.
Ibis’s can fuck off back to their home planet!
A seagull’s a bird that scabs hot chips, 
And there's only one bird that's scabbier than this -

It's the ibis (ibis) picnic wrecking irrits.
It’s the ibis (ibis) I hope they don’t come near us.
It's the ibis (ibis) Bin juice drinking jerks.
It’s the ibis (ibis) they’re the fucken shittest birds.

The ibis is a picnic wrecking, burden on humanity.
A dumpster diving, bin-chicken, disrupting the community,
Annoying the general public, at every opportunity.
Disgrace to feathered creatures, bringing shame on the bird family!

If there are any Ibis’s watching this, firstly - there’s no bin-juice here, so you can fuck off.
Secondly, get a job and fucken do something with your life. Sort it out, you’re on the road to nowhere…
Go migrate to that garbage island floating in the middle of the pacific ocean or some shit. I dunno. I’m not your Dad, I can’t tell you how to live your life, Just… Do something, and stop wrecking everyone’s picnics. Fuck.

It's the ibis (ibis) bin-juice drinking cunt!
It’s the ibis (ibis) that’s ruining your lunch!
It's the ibis (ibis) picnic-wrecking jerk!
It’s the ibis (ibis) what a cunt of a bird.
….. If I was an Ibis I’d go kill myself…."

Written and Performed by Christiaan Van Vuuren.
Animated by Connor Van Vuuren.
Recorded and Mixed by Alex Mills at Song Zu.
Backing Track is 'Payday' by Jason Farnham: https://youtu.be/-96SMUqYA1k

FULL LYRICS BELOW:

VERSE 1:
In Australia we've got deadly animals a plenty.
We've got funnel web spiders who'll murder you and your family.
Under every second rock is a red back spider.
And they’ll kill ya just cause, I dunno, they're bored or whatever.

We got invisible brown snakes who'll bite you on the foot,
And you’ll be dead in seven minutes, like that, kaput.
We've got the world's deadliest creatures all over the place.
We've got magpies who'll steal the eyeballs from your face -

But at least we don't have AR-15's.

VERSE 2:
We've got great white sharks who'll ascend from the deep,
And rip ya in half with their razor sharp teeth.
We've got salt water crocs who'll death-roll you to death,
and sea-snakes who'll gladly snatch your last breath. 

We've got a blue ringed octopus no bigger than this,
that just sits around in rock pools waiting to kill kids.
And even the platypus, a cute beaver-duck thing,
has got a spur on it’s ankle that’ll kill ya in one sting. 

But at least we don't have AR-15's.
And at least they can't end up in the hands of psychopathic teens.

VERSE 3:
We've got stonefish and stingrays and sea-urchins and shit,
and hectic fucken homicidal box jellyfish,
and these Jellyfish they aren’t even sentient beings,
they don’t even really do stuff or know about things. 

They just float around on the whim of the currents,
being pointless non-cognitive murderous cunts.
And if that weren't enough in terms of natural hazards,
here in Australia the sun causes cancer.

But at least we don't have AR-15's.
And at least they can't end up in the hands of suicidal teens.
And at least we don't have an NRA, who pay millions of dollars every day, buying off politicians not to change old laws.

VERSE 4:
We got bull sharks, cone shells, salt water crocodiles.
Honey bees, european wasps, and blue ringed octopi's.
Death adders, blue bottles, red back spiders.
Tiger sharks, tiger snakes, and lizards that'll bite ya. 

We got Sea snakes, taipans, cassowaries, copperheads,
all the creatures of the land and sky and sea that want you dead.
Toadfish, stonefish, irukandgi jellyfish -
Bull ants, centipedes, and ticks that cause paralysis. 

But thank fuck we don't have AR-15's.
And thank fuck they can't end up in the hands psychopathic suicidal teens. And thank fuck we don't have an NRA, who pay millions of dollars every day, buying off politicians not to change some law. 

A law that was written 200 years ago,
in a time when it took three minutes to reload,
a single round of ammunition, and we knew nothing about depression,
and you couldn't fire 45 rounds in sixty seconds.

And there wasn't even such a thing as automatic weapons.
And there weren't thirty one mass-shootings monthly…
but what would I know cause I'm from another country."

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning

I didn't mean to hurt you dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I can't get along

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you dear

Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I'm so colder now.

My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you dad
You know I'm gonna be like you""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home dad?
I don't know when, but we'll get together then son
You know we'll have a good time then

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw"", I said ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's ok""
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son?
I don't know when, but we'll get together then son
You know we'll have a good time then

Well, he came home from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son?
I don't know when, but we'll get together then son
You know we'll have a good time then

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you""

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son?
I don't know when, but we'll get together then son
You know we'll have a good time then"

“Down In It” Lyrics
Kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the sky
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe
Sometimes I don't believe them myself
And I decided I was never coming down
Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye
It was just about too small to see
But I watched it way too long
That dot was pulling me down
I was up above it, I was up above it
I was up above it, I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
Shut up, So what does it matter now
I was swimming in the hate now I crawl on the ground
And everything I never liked about you
Is kind of seeping into me
I try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out
I guess the jokes on me, she said
I was up above it, I was up above it
I was up above it, I was up above it
I used to be so big and strong
I used to know my right from wrong
I used to never be afraid
I used to be somebody
I used to have something inside
Now just this hole it's open wide
Used to want it all
I used to be somebody
I'll cross my heart and hope to die
But the needle's already in my eye
And all the world's weight is on my back and I don't even know why.
And what I used to think was me is just a fading memory
I looked him right in the eye and said goodbye
I was up above it, I was up above it
I was up above it, I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
Rain rain go away
Come again some other day
Rain rain go away
Come again some other day
Rain rain go away
Come again some other day
Rain rain go away
Come again some other day
I was up above it, I was up above it
I was up above it, I was up above it
Now I'm down in it

Lyrics:
Is Dexter ill, Is Dexter ill, Is Dexter ill
Is Dexter ill today, Mr Kirk, Dexter's in school
I'm afraid he's not, Miss Fishborne
Dexter's truancy problem is way out of hand
The Baltimore County school board have decided to expel
Dexter from the entire public school system

Oh Mr Kirk, I'm as upset as you to learn of Dexter's truancy
But surely, expulsion is not the answer!
I'm afraid expulsion is the only answer
It's the opinion of the entire staff that Dexter is criminally insane

That boy needs therapy, psychosomatic,
That boy needs therapy, purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch! What does that mean?
You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Play the kazoo, let's have it tune
On the count of three
That, that, that, that, that boy.. boy needs therapy
He was white as a sheet
And he also made false teeth

Avalanches is above, business continues below
Did I ever tell you the story about
Cowboys! Bit , bit bitches and the indians and, Fron, Frontier Psychiatrist
I, I felt strangely hypnotised
I was in another world, a world of 20.000 girls
And milk! Rectangles, to an optometrist, the man with the golden eyeball
And tighten your buttocks, pour juice on your chin
I promise my girlfriend I'd, the violin, violin, violin

Frontier Psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier

That boy needs therapy, psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy, purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch, what does that mean?
You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Ranagazoo, let's have a tune
Now when I count three
That, that, that, that, that boy.. boy needs therapy
He was white as a sheet
And he also made false teeth

Frontier Psychiatrist

Can you think of anything else that talks, other than a person?
Uh ohh, uh oh, a bird! Yeah!
Sometimes a parrot talks
Ha ha ha ha ha !!!!
Yes, some birds are funny when they talk
Can you think of anything else
A record, record, record !

LYRICS

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know

Somebody...

Life Goes On

Written by: Ray Davies
Published by: Davray Music Ltd.

stereo mix, recorded 22-30 Sep, 1976 at Konk Studios, Hornsey, London

Life Goes On

A friend of mine just had a real bad time.
You see, his life was shattered and he lost his mind.
His girl ran off along with his best friend,
And through emotional stress he brought his life to an end.
It was such a tragedy,
But that's the way it's got to be.
Life goes on.

Life goes on.
It happens ev'ry day.
So appreciate what you got
Before it's taken away.
Life will hit you
When you're unprepared,
So be grateful and take all
That you can while you're there.
Get that frown off your head,
'Cause you're a long time dead.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on.

No use runnin' 'round lookin' scared,
Life could get you when you're unaware.
One day it's gonna come, so you better accept it.
Life will hit you when you least expect it.
And one day when you are gone,
You know that life will still go on.
But no one'll care if you've been good, bad, right or wrong.
Life will still go on.

My bank went broke and my well ran dry.
It was almost enough to contemplate suicide.
I turned on the gas, but I soon realized
I hadn't settled my bill so they cut off my supply.
No matter how I try, it seems I'm too young to die.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on.

Tornado, cyclone and hurricane
Can batter the houses with the thunder and rain.
Blizzards can blow; the waves hit the shore,
But the people recover and come back for more.
Somehow the people fight back, even the future looks black.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on."

Gotye- Somebody That I Use To Know

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know, that I used to know, I used to know somebody

The new music video from OK Go, made in partnership with Chevrolet. OK Go set up over 1000 instruments over two miles of desert outside Los Angeles. A Chevy Sonic was outfitted with retractable pneumatic arms designed to play the instruments, and the band recorded this version of Needing/Getting, singing as they played the instrument array with the car. The video took 4 months of preparation and 4 days of shooting and recording. There are no ringers or stand-ins; Damian took stunt driving lessons. Each piano had the lowest octaves tuned to the same note so that they'd play the right note no matter where they were struck. Many thanks to Chevy for believing in and supporting such an insane and ambitious project, and to Gretsch for providing the guitars and amps.

Lyrics:
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Lyrics:
Say hey!
Cha

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Three, four!
""The representative from California has the floor.""
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
And kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday

There's an albatross around your neck
All the things you've said and the things you've done
Can you carry it with no regrets
Can you stand the person you've become

Oooh there's a light
Oooh there's a light

Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross, shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight of living

Stepping forward out into the day
Shrugging off the dust of memory
Though it's soaring still above your head
It is out of sight and none shall see

Oooh there's a light
Oooh there's a light

Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross, shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake the weight of living

It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes

Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross, shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake the weight of living

The weight of living
The weight of living
The weight of living
The weight of living"

Lyrics:
All I wanna do is
Live in ecstasy
I know what's best for me

I can't help it
It's this hopeless age
I just wanna feel purple, yellow, red, and blue

When I grow up I want to be
A movie star or on tv
Cause working just don't work for me
But I can't focus feeling hopeless
So I'll just sit back and try to look mean

All I wanna do is
Live in ecstasy
I know what's best for me

I can't help it
It's this hopeless age
I just wanna feel purple, yellow, red, and blue

When I grow up I want to be
A rich kid born celebrity
It's not greed but necessity
Now I don't focus on the hopeless when I look out it's only for me

All I wanna do is
Live in ecstasy
I know what's best for me

I can't help it
It's this hopeless age
I just wanna feel purple yellow red and blue

I just wanna be evil
Purple, yellow, red, and blue

All that I needed
Is something to believe in
Cause everything just falls in place like that

Portugal. The Man took 2017 by the horns after a considerably long gap, between records. They spent years working on an album called Gloomin + Doomin before later developing what would become known as their latest studio album WOODSTOCK. Fate struck lead singer, John Gourley, twice. First, John got some parental tough love from his old man. “What’s taking so long to finish the album?,” John’s dad asked. “Isn’t that what bands do? Write songs and then put them out?” The whole thing got John thinking about why the band seemed to be stuck on a musical elliptical machine from hell and more importantly, about how to get off of it. Second, John found his dad’s ticket stub from the original 1969 Woodstock music festival, which ultimately knocked something loose in his head. He realized that, in the same tradition of bands from that era, Portugal. The Man needed to speak out about the world crumbling around them.

With these two ideas converging, the band made a seemingly bat-shit-crazy decision: they took all of the work they had done for the three years prior and threw it out. The band went back to the studio – working with John Hill, Danger Mouse and longtime collaborator Casey Bates. In this new-found creative territory, the album that became WOODSTOCK rolled out naturally from there. Fast forward to present day and it was impossible to escape the album’s first single “Feel It Still,” which dominated the charts and radio airwaves in 2017. The 6X Platinum Certified hit reigned at #1 at nearly all radio formats, including Top 40, as well as Alternative, where the song held the chart’s top spot for a mind-blowing 20 weeks, breaking the record for most weeks at #1. Yes, you read that right. 5 guys from Wasilla, Alaska who have played nearly 1,500 shows in their career broke Alternative radio records and had a #1 song at Pop radio. Billboard Magazine even went as far as to call the song, “the unexpected rock crossover hit of 2017,” while Rolling Stone listed it as “one of the best songs of 2017.” AND THEN…the band kicked off 2018 by winning a GRAMMY Award for “Feel It Still.” WOODSTOCK has since been certified gold, as has their second single “Live In The Moment”.

Lyrics:

i'm picking up really sketch vibes
my woman's been telling me lies
about other men
about where she's been hanging

suspicious thoughts in my mind
been brewing up over time
""he's just a friend,""
when to me he's a stranger

i can hold no evidence
but I can't think emotionless
and something in your choice of dress
tonight can lead to just one guess

white lies
you try
can't blind my eyes
you got your red dress on
and you want to play
like I can't know things that I've never seen

its been keeping me up every night
most of the time
i toss and turn in bed and i try
not to explode
when you arrive
sneaking through the door
like it ain't 5
like this house ain't mine

yes i been picking up really sketch vibes
and i keep looking over at your side
wondering where you been
thinking that he ain't a friend
knowing that thoughts are a sin
and so I'll say it again"

LYRICS:

I promise I really totally care who wins
If there's a net or hoop or hole in the ground, I hope they get it in
If they want to go to all the bases, I hope they do
If they're supposed to run past a line or whatever, I hope they do that, too

Sports go sports!

May they top their opponents numerically in the allotted time
Lest they disenfranchise their audience
and see their revenues decline

May the partakers be sturdy and rapid
In the spirited energies they exert
May they be victorious in perpetuity
Don't I look cute in this football shirt






Sports go sports!  Athletics are number one! Participants are heroes!  Go team yeah!

This is the most important thing that's ever occurred
The vicarious fulfillment of your dream that got deferred
You has aspirations as a kid but you didn't have the skill
So you watch genetically superior people do the things you never will

Sports go Sports!

May the competitors you prefer
best their opposing equivalents:
So you can somehow feel connected to the feat of your self-appointed constituents
May the hours you spend watching post-match pontificators
Amplify the thrill of being a witness
And better your predictive aptitude
For your squad's future physical fitness

Sports go sports!  Athletics are number one! Participants are heroes!  Go team yeah!


Watching abile-bodied millionaires play with each other
Watching less agile millionaire talk about it on TV
May they compile copious points so they are rewarded and meritorious
So you feel temporarily, adjacently  victorious

Sports go sports!  Athletics are number one! Participants are heroes!  Go team yeah!

Every other word:
Sports!  Sports!  Athletics!  Number! Participants! Heroes!  Go!  Yeah!

Every other other word:
Go!  Athletics!  Number!  Are!  Team!

Now in Latin:
Ludis ire ludis
Arcu sunt optimum
Participants sunt heroes
Ire quadrigus sic

Now the truth:
If you could only throw a ball
You'd have a hotter wife
Lots and lots of money
And a way better life
And a way better life
Go Sports!"

Lyrics
Pharrell Williams- Happy

It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here come bad news, talking this and that
(Yeah) Well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back
(Yeah) Well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
(Yeah) No offense to you, don't waste your time
Here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Hey, come on, uh
Bring me down, can't nuthin' (happy)
Bring me down
My level is too high to bring me down (happy)
Can't nuthin', bring me down (happy)
I said, let me tell you now, unh (happy)
Bring me down, can't nuthin', bring me down (happy, happy, happy)
My level is too high to bring me down (happy, happy, happy)
Can't nuthin' bring me down (happy, happy, happy)
I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Come on, unh bring me down can't nuthin' (happy, happy, happy)
Bring me down my level is too high (happy, happy, happy)
Bring me down can't nuthin' (happy, happy, happy)
Bring me down, I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you, eh eh eh

Lyrics:


Well we're all wasted in a bar somewhere downtown
When I man walks up and pokes me with a knife and says
""Man, I'm gonna send you to hell.""
Well I took that knife, I stared him straight in the eyes
I said, ""Oh, boy you better fuckin' run
I've been sittin' here just a-slammin' down beers
And now its time to have some fun""
Oh


Oh well he hit me hard, yeah he hit me good
And then I fell to the ground
But I kicked him fast, I kicked him real swift
And he came a tumblin' down
He took a stab at me and nearly cut my gut
But I kicked that knife to the floor
Then I took his head and slammed it into the bar
I don't think he'll come around no more
Oh


Well I've been drinkin' here for so many damn years
Tryin' to recap my life
Every night trouble finds my sight and I can't help but fight
With a bottle of Jack and a tin of skoal
I'll be stickin' around
Until the day a man will put me away and...
I can rest my soul"

This one is for the song Text Me in The Morning by Neon Trees of their newest album Pop Psychology. I hope you enjoy.
Lyrics are also in description.


We danced a tango 'till our heads got dizzy
I felt your body heat: a damsel in distress
My daddy warned me not to get so busy
And suddenly I'm watching you take off your dress
I couldn't stick around

So text me in the morning
Tell me you still love me
I don't believe a single word
You tell me you're tipsy;
I tell you you're pretty
We could spend the night if you're still sure
But text me in the morning

Woke up all soaking wet from last night's fever
Smelling like cigarettes and broken promises
Your mother said: 'Don't be an overachiever.'
I please her, oh please girl, I never did believe her
And I'll never tell you why
Oh, I'll never tell a lie

So text me in the morning
Tell me you still love me
I don't believe a single word
You tell me you're tipsy;
I tell you you're pretty
We could spend the night if you're still sure
But text me in the morning

Tears on my phone
Feelin' so alone
I'll never let you go, you've got the best of me
When all the other boys just want your sex
I just want your texts
In the morning

Right, in the morning

C'mon c'mon c'mon

So text me in the morning
Tell me you still love me
I don't believe a single word
You tell me you're tipsy, I tell you you're pretty
We could spend the night if you're still sure
But text me in the morning

We danced a tango 'till our heads got dizzy
(Text me in the morning)

I felt your body heat: a damsel in distress
(Text me in the morning)

Woke up all soaking wet from last night's fever
(Text me in the morning)

Smelling like cigarettes and broken promises"

LYRICS:
High in the clouds, up on a hill
You talk to the stars, they tell you to chill
I try to tell you what everyone knows
You're perfect in the way that you are

If you stole all the colors that persist in the air
Sold them to black without much of a care
Drew on my art, bleeped every sound
I'd thank you cause you left me my heart
Compassion always set you apart

You and I will always belong
So give a little sing to your song
Don't be sad or scared at all
Even if you can't recall, you're perfect in the way that you are
Perfect in the way that you are

If you took a boat to the middle of sea
And spent all my money seeking treasures for me
But came up empty-handed every week after week
I'd tell you that your love is still cheap
That you are worth the trouble to keep

You and I will always belong
So give a little sing to your song
Don't be sad or scared at all
Even if you can't recall, you're perfect in the way that you are
Perfect in the way that you are

Even if you're slightly ajar
Even if you're looking bizarre
Even though you failed us so far
You're perfect in the way that you are
Even when you're coming apart
Even when you're breaking my heart
Even when you love a la carte
[You're perfect in the way that you are]

Perfect in the way that you are
You're perfect in the way that you are
Perfect in the way that you are"

Lyrics

I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind
And I'll use you as a focal point
So I don't lose sight of what I want
And I've moved further than I thought I could
But I missed you more than I thought I would
And I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind

And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me

And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me

And I'll use you as a makeshift gauge
Of how much to give and how much to take
I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind

And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me

And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me

Oh, and I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me

And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me"

Lola was the lead single from the album ""Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One"" originally released in the UK and the US in June 1970 and reached number two on the UK Singles Chart nine on the Billboard Hot 100.

Lyrics

I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like
Coca Cola
C-O-L-A Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, ""Lola""
L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, ""Little boy, won't you come home with me?""
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes
Well, I almost fell for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her, and she at me
Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, ""Little boy, gonna make you a man""
Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola"

Strangers was  released in November 1970 as track 3 on the album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One', the album reached no.35 on the US album charts. One of two tracks written by Dave Davies on the album.

Lyrics:

Where are you going, I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go? What will I see?
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to, I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two, we are one
So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Til peace we find, tell you what I'll do
All the things I own I will share with you
And, if I feel tomorrow like I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two, we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there, make your play
'Cause soon I fear you're gonna carry us away
And a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And, if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two, we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two, we are one"

And you, you’ve got your armor on. Nights out in babylon, yeah, nights out in babylon.
But maybe all you need is someone to trust, maybe all you need is someone.
And I won’t let you down, no I won’t let you down. I won’t let you down, my love.
I won’t let you down.

Now Emily’s got no tricks to try, but she don’t seem that much to mind, no she don’t
seem to mind that much to me.
And you’ve got what the whole world wants, so strap that armor tighter on, double on
down like it’s gonna make you free.
But maybe all you need is someone to trust, maybe all you need is someone.
And I won’t let you down, no I won’t let you down. I won’t let you down, my love.
I won’t let you down.

Lyrics
Taylor Swift- Shake It Off

I stay out too late, got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmm hmm, that's what people say, mmm hmm
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say mmm mmm, that's what people say mmm mmm
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind, sayin' gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see mmm mmm, that's what they don't see mmm mmm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own), I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know mmm mmm, that's what they don't know mmm mmm
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my mind saying it's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats in the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like ""oh my God"", but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake, yeah oh
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate me)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (the fakers baby)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

The official 'Writing's On The Wall' music video.

Lyrics:
I’ve been here before
But always hit the floor
I’ve spent a lifetime running
And I always get away
But with you I’m feeling something
That makes me want to stay

Unprepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I’m going to make it through the day
Then there’s no more use in running
This is something I’ve got to face

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?
How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love
Run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cos the writing’s on the wall

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won’t be afraid

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?
How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love
Run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cos the writing’s on the wall

The writing’s on the wall

How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love
Run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?

How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love
Run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?

For you I have to risk it all
Cos the writing’s on the wall

LYRICS
Welcome to the end of eras
Ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die
If it feels good, tastes good
It must be mine
Dynasty decapitated
You just might see a ghost tonight

And if you don't know now you know...

I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
Oh yeah
The crown...
So close I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
Oh yeah

Sycophants on velvet sofas
Lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than Royal
Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
If it feels good, tastes good
It must be mine
Heroes always get remembered
But you know legends never die

Mortal kings are ruling castles
Welcome to my world of fun
Liars settle into sockets
Flip the switch and watch them run"

Lyrics
Adele- Hello

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Lyrics:
Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the morning comes
What if I'm late, gotta big date, gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay, I gotta run, run, yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone, I gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late
There was a time when we could dance until a quarter to ten,
We never thought it would end then, we never thought it would end
We used to carry on and drink and do the rock and roll
We never thought we'd get older
We never thought it'd grow cold, but now
Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the morning comes
What if I'm late, gotta big date, gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay, I gotta run, run, yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone, I gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late
Down by the sea she knew a sailor who had been to war
She never even knew a sailor before, she never even knew his name
He'd come to town and he would pound her for a couple of days
And then he'd sail across the bubbly waves and those were happier days, but now
Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the morning comes
What if I'm late, gotta big date, gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay I gotta run, run, yeah
Gotta get home pick up the phone, I gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late

LYRICS:

You got two black eyes from loving too hard
And a black car that matches your blackest soul
I wouldn't change ya, oh oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no
The neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
And the black tar palms keep weeping your name
I couldn't change ya, oh oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no
The high rise lights read your rights
And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change ya, oh oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee"

Lyrics:
Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, miss-spells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, misspells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

In hell I'll be in Good Company

lyrics:
I put my foot in my mouth again
I hope they still want to be my friends
I got desirable qualities
if you don't mind my obsessing with me

I kept repeating myself yesterday
repeating myself I keep on yesterday
I want a people that I can call home
but why do the work when I'm doing just fine all on my own

and I don't mind being alone
I'm doing fine me on my own

sometimes I worry that people can hear
what i'm thinking spilling out of my ears
I calculate what I'm going to say
talking to people's a game I can play

I'm working hard to look like I don't try
but I get rosy when I say goodbye
it's probably true that I want to be known
but why do the work when I'm doing just fine all on my own

and I'm trying to read
what you want from me
and I'm trying to read

Lyrics
Ed Sheeran- Shape of You

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Lyrics:
These words are my own
Threw some chords together
The combination
D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you
Try to focus my attention
But I feel so
A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration (But it's not coming easily) Whoah oh!
Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?
Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later
These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you,
I love you,
I love you,
I love you
There's no other way
To better say I love you,
I love you..."

I Love My Kitty Cat

I love my kitty cat yes I do
I love my kitty cat oh I do
And all I wanna do is to give her lots of love
Give her lots of love and a kiss and a hug

I love my kitty cat yes I do
I love my kitty cat oh I do
And all I wanna do is to give her lots of treats
Give her lots of treat and kiss her little feets

No more waiting for a friend
She’s my pal to the end

And all I wanna do is to give her lots of love
Give her lots of love and a kiss and a hug"

Lyrics:
If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle class and tame
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the love that never came
You want it darker
We kill the flame

If you are the dealer, let me out of the game
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Hineni
Hineni, hineni
Hineni

Lyrics
OutKast- Hey Ya

1, 2, 3, uh!
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But ""got it"" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We've been together, oh, we've been together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is ""Nothing is forever""
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your mama (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest (Uh-oh)
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest

Hey, alright now, alright now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
I can't hear ya
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh, hey ya!)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Oh, oh, uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

Lyrics:

we’ll never get free
lamb to the slaughter
what you gonna do when there’s blood in the water
the price of your greed is your sons and your daughters
what you gonna do when there’s blood in the water…

look me in my eyes
tell me everythings not fine
oh the people ain’t happy
and the river has run dry

you thought you could go free
But the system is done for
if you listen real closely
theres a knock at your front door

we’ll never get free
lamb to the slaughter
what you gonna do when there’s blood in the water
the price of your greed is your sons and your daughters
what you gonna do when there’s blood in the water…
when there’s blood in the water!

beg me for mercy
admit you were toxic
you poisoned me just for
another dollar in your pocket

now I am the violence
I am the sickness
won't accept your silence
beg me for forgiveness

we’ll never get free
lamb to the slaughter
what you gonna do when there’s blood in the water
the price of your greed is your sons and your daughters
what you gonna do when there’s blood in the water…
when there’s blood in the water!

I am the people
I am the storm
I am the riot
I am the swarm
when the last tree has fallen the animal can’t hide
money won't solve it
what's your Alibi
what’s your alibi
what’s your alibi
whatcha gonna do when there’s blood in the blood in the water
when there’s blood in the water

This video has a lot of flashing colors.  If you're susceptible to seizures, be careful, please.  Your viewing experience will look significantly better if you manually set your YouTube resolution settings to 1440p or 2160p (for desktop, click the gear icon in the lower right). Just leaving it on “Auto HD” results in some pretty intense distortion during a few sections, because when the the colors and patterns get crazy, there’s actually just too much information flying by for YouTube’s normal HD compression. We broke the matrix. The good people of YouTube have been working with us to solve this (it’s a bit rate limitation issue) over the last 24 hours, but there’s no quick fix, and now it’s Thanksgiving in the US, and we’re all with our families.

We hope you like it!  Many, many thanks to our collaborators at Double A (http://us.doubleapaper.com/ok-go-enter-to-win-contest).

Lyrics
Camila Cabello- Havana

Hey...Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that ""how you doin'?"" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na
Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
My heart is in Havana (ay)
Havana, ooh na-na
Jeffery

Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn
Fresh out East Atlanta
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ay)
Back it on me, shawty cravin' on me
Get to diggin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
This is history in the makin' on me (on me)
Point blank, close range, that be
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)
I was gettin' mula, man they feel me
Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh no)

Everyone once in a while you meet a special kind man
A needle in a haystack, a diamond in a pile of shit
A man who’s never written music but thinks he can
A republican crypto currency guy like Dan

Thank you, digital accountant Dan
For explaining how to write a song
I wouldn’t have known to choose a topic
Before you, you, Dan, you came along

Thanks for telling me to write down my thoughts
And send them all to you
So you can make sure it doesn’t offend
The conservative point of view

You say it’s time to pop my liberal bubble
And reach across the aisle
Find levity in relatable things
That can make the red and blue states smile

Because comedy should be inclusive
And connect with the other half
It should make us all feel comfortable
So both sides can laugh

Well, I’m going to take your advice, computer Dan
And write something bipartisan
So here’s my song

VERSE 1:
Don’t you hate it when you’re liberal and you’re stuck in traffic
Now I’m late for my big meeting
Don’t you hate it when you’re conservative and your inlaws are here
Oh brother what’s your mother gonna say
Don’t you hate it when you’re liberal and you lose your glasses
How can I find my glasses without my glasses
Or when you’re a conservative and your gun control policies enable constant, senseless, devastating mass shootings
Isn’t it great when both sides can laugh
Hahahahahahaha

We’re really not that different
We should come together as one
With easy, pleasing, breezy jokes
You know comedy can just be fun

CHORUS:
So let’s all get together
And embrace the other half
With this song
Where both sides can laugh

VERSE TWO:
Don’t you hate it when you’re liberal and a song’s in your head
Maureen I’m not a theater person
Or when you’re conservative and your podcast won’t load
It’ll only play an ad from blue apron
Don’t you hate when you’re liberal and you can’t stop crying
Boo hoo I want civil rights
Or when you’re conservative and your pussy grabbing liar threatens nuclear annihilation on twitter
Isn’t it great when both sides can laugh
Hahahahahahaha

In this time of political turmoil
I should ignore it and be polite
It’s more comfortable for all of us
If I don’t pick between left and wrong

CHORUS:
So let’s all get together
And embrace the other half
With this song
Where both sides can laugh

BRIDGE:
If I want a ceasefire to transpire
Stop preaching to the whining lefty choir
Embrace the climate change denier
Give every joke a qualifier

With harmless, responsible comedy
Where we all feel good about our choices
That recognizes everyone
As equally valid political voices

Comedians should be on the medians
And put a premium on obedience
Be through with mental acuity
Find unity through ambiguity

All this complaining and exaggerating
Is actually just exacerbating
The futility and hypocrisy
Of the left wing aristocracy

Let go of the same old blue shtick
Stop trying to skew shit
I sound like a mouthy shrew chick
Acoustic music isn’t psychotherapeutic

I need to get a clue quick
If I want to accrue new YouTube clicks
Subdue this taboo shit I spew
Find a new, more palatable point of view

Well you underestimated me
Cause I don’t look like the enemy
My tentacles are venom-y
A musical comedy sea anemone

But I should say it’s okay
That no matter the cost, you want your little pistol
And it’s fine that voted for Voldemort
As long as your reasons were purely fiscal
Oh, you’re just greedy, I didn’t realize, that’s fine

CHORUS:
So let’s all get together
And embrace the other half
With this song
Where both sides can laugh

CODA:
What do you think, Dan, how did I do
I can’t believe I used to write songs that had point of view
Being general’s always better for comedy it’s true
Thank god for you, Dan, thank only Christian god for you"

Lyrics:
I’m too tired to worry
Oh, bout the way it was
I’m just trying to love you
So I don’t have to clean it up

Oh, don’t let your blood run cold
Don’t let your heart be stoned
Don’t be the bitter one
Oh, some things can’t be undone
Some bullets that you chose Can’t go back in the gun

Can’t put the bullets back into the gun
Can’t undo what we have done Can’t break this heart of stone
Can’t put the bullets back into the gun
Can’t undo what we have done Can’t break this heart of stone

I ain’t made to carry
All this weight on my own
Oh, it’s way too heavy
And I can’t be that strong"

LYRICS

when i'm furthest from myself   •far away•
feeling closer to the stars   •outer space•
i've been invaded by the dark   •can't escape•
trying to recognize myself when i feel i've been replaced

i can feel a kick down in my soul
and its pulling me back to earth to let me know
i am not a slave, cant be contained
so pick me from the dark and pull me from the grave

'cause

i still feel alive
when it is hopeless, i start to notice
that i still feel alive
falling forward back into orbit

so when i lose my gravity in this sleepy womb
drifting as i dream, but i'll wake up soon
to realize the hand of life is reaching out
to rid me of my pride i call allegiance to myself

i can feel a kick down in my soul
it's pulling me back to earth to let me know
and this heart that beats inside of me will show
it will show

floating in outer space,  have i misplaced a part of my soul?
lost in the in between,  or so it seems,  i'm out of control
floating in outer space,   have i misplaced a part of my soul
lost in the in between but i cant keep me asleep for long

'cause

i still feel alive   •i can feel it•
when it is hopeless   •it ain't hopeless•
i start to notice   •start to notice•
i still feel alive   •i can feel it•
falling forward   •falling forward•
back into orbit   •yeah•

Lyrics:
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm only good at being bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

Its a process getting covers up on spotify. An expensive process I don't have plans on any time in the immediate future, but I am working as hard as I can to get more music up ASAP. Counterintuitive records collaborated with me in the summer of 2019 to put out my debut cover record which is streaming, SO show that some love and i'll know ya'll wanting more of my content on streaming platforms is real!

Check out my Actual Ska band, We Are The Union (We are on spotify, bandcamp, itunes, youtube, and pretty much most streaming sites) Our new record entitled ""Self Care"" NOW STREAMING literally everywhere

A little tribute to Dave Greenfield (keyboardist with The Stranglers who died with Covid-19 last week) and Paul Desmond (saxophonist with the Dave Brubeck quartet - the anniversary of his death is at the end of this month). Also because I've been enjoying editing videos and recording stuff over the last couple of months.

A couple of people have asked how I made this video so here we go -
I took a clip from a 1964 live version of Take Five (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT9Eh8wNMkw) and made the drum loop by chopping up the intro and turning it from 5/4 into the 3/4 - 4/4 groove that Golden Brown has. The upright bass sound is sequenced from Logic, and the piano part was played in using one of the piano sounds from a Nord Electro 5D. Then I played the sax part over the top (I play a King Zephyr alto and for this I used a hard rubber Yanigasawa mouthpiece rather than my usual bright Guardala).
The video was then edited using the clip I'd taken the drum loop from.

Pará pílís, trahe amícós
Perdere, fingere fruor

Ó nón, cupídinem sció

Sine lúce, angor minus
Oblectáte, nunc híc sumus
Mé sentió aeger, stultus
Oblectáte, nunc híc sumus
Barbarus, albínus, culex et, mea libídó
Hei! Hae, ha ha ha ha!

Peior est bonitás meá
Ipsó múnere beátus sum
Noster globus semper fuit
Et úsque ad fínem erit

Et cúr sapere dédiscó
Ita, ut rídére, putó
Dúrum rébar, dúrum rérí
O vah, bene, níl tantí

Negátió! Negátió! Negátió! Negátió! Negátió!

Summertime Sadness, by Lana Del Rey (Bardcore/Medieval Style)

Good day fine people! I present a eulogy for a rather unpleasant summer, and wish you all a happier autumn!

In other news, I will likely be holding off on pursuing Spotify until I have enough songs to just upload a proper album. Rest assured I will announce it the moment I do. Also, I'd love to share another fun interview I did a little while back for those of you who are interested: https://bit.ly/3lMJqTv

Lyrics:
Kiss me once before thou goest
Summertide sorrow
I have loved thee the most
And shall love thee to my barrow

I don my red surcoat tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Like Godiva, hair loose down to the thigh
Pattens off, I feel so alive

Oh, by God! I feel it in the air
Cathedral bells above a-ringing like a prayer
How my heart’s afire! I feel it everywhere
Naught can daunt me anymore

Kiss me once before thou goest
Summertide sorrow
I have loved thee the most
And shall love thee to my barrow

‘Tis but summertide,
Summertide sorrow
Summertide, summertide sorrow
‘Tis but summertide, summertide sorrow
Oh, oh, oh

I feel the wind with every stride
Riding nearly swift as the arrow flies
With my vagabond by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I shall die happy tonight

Oh, by God! I feel it in the air
Cathedral bells above a-ringing like a prayer
How my heart’s afire! I feel it everywhere
Naught can daunt me anymore

Kiss me once before thou goest
Summertide sorrow
I have loved thee the most
And shall love thee to my barrow

‘Tis the summertide,
Summertide sorrow
Summertide, summertide sorrow
‘Tis the summertide, summertide sorrow
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

I shall miss thee forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later is better than never
E’en if thou art gone, I shall yet ride, ride, ride

‘Tis but summertide,
Summertide sorrow
Summertide, summertide sorrow
‘Tis but summertide, summertide sorrow
Oh, oh, oh

Kiss me once before thou goest
Summertide sorrow
I have loved thee the most
And shall love thee to my barrow

‘Tis but summertide,
Summertide sorrow
Summertide, summertide sorrow
‘Tis but summertide, summertide sorrow
Oh, oh, oh"

Lyrics for grandson - Dirty :)
[Verse 1]
Is it time to lead or is it time to die?
Time to raise up or walk on by?
Is there anybody out there that's payin’ attention?
Yeah, yeah
Is it time to speak up or time for silence?
Time for peace or is it time for violence?
Is there anybody out there that's payin' attention?
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell what you tryna hide
And what you’re runnin' from inside
'Cause I got a surprise
We might not make it 'til the morning
So go on and tell me now

[Chorus]
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?
It isn't not much but it's a good start
So go and get your hands dirty
Do you love your neighbor?
Is it in your nature?
Do you love the sunset?
Aren't you fed up? (Yeah)
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
To go and get your hands dirty

[Verse 2]
I got a skeleton under the floorboard
I got a secret I need you to keep
Runaway, runaway, you have been forewarned
I don't wanna go off in the deep
If we don’t do somethin’ more, we stuck up in the mud again
Don't wanna mess it up ’cause I want everything and nothing at all
I got a feeling and they walkin' on the ceilin'
If the people need the healin' then [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell what you tryna hide
And what you’re runnin' from inside
'Cause I got a surprise
We might not make it 'til the morning
So go on and tell me now

[Chorus]
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?
It isn't not much but it's a good start
So go and get your hands dirty
Do you love your neighbor?
Is it in your nature?
Do you love the sunset?
Aren't you fed up? (Yeah)
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
To go and get your hands dirty

[Bridge]
Is there anybody out there that's payin' attention?
Is there anybody out there that's payin' attention?
Is there anybody out there that's payin' attention?
Is there anybody out there- (There, there, there, there, there)
So go on and tell me now (Oh)

[Chorus]
Do you have enough love in your heart
(Do you have enough love in your heart)
To go and get your hands dirty?
Isn't not much but it's a good start (A good start)
So go and get your hands dirty
Do you love your neighbor?
Is it in your nature?
Do you love the sunset?
Aren't you fed up? (Yeah)
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
To go and get your hands dirty

LYRICS

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you want it, say so

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you want it, say so

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you really ain't been yourself
Tell me what must I do (do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you front then I'll be bouncing
If you want it scream and shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you want it, say so

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you want it, say so (yeah)

Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy?
Shut it, save it, keep it, push
Why you beating 'round the bush?
And knowing you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (yeah, yeah)
And we can dance all day around it
If you front then I'll be bouncing
If you want it scream and shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you want it, say so

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you want it, say so"
