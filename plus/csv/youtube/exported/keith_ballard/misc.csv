The ancestors of modern, squishy cephalopods like the octopus and the squid all had shells. In ancient times, their shell was their greatest asset but it eventually proved to be their biggest weakness.

Special thanks to Franz Anthony for the beautiful cephalopod reconstructions. You can see more of Franz's tremendous work at http://252mya.com

And thanks as always to Nobumichi Tamura for allowing us to use his wonderful paleoart: http://spinops.blogspot.com/

"zwqPiZ4Wgys","Off Grid Heating Prototype- Copper Coil Water Heater / Heat Exchanger / Radiant Heater","The Outsider","2023-10-14","2019-08-31","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zwqPiZ4Wgys/hqdefault.jpg","With an ammo box, mason jar, and copper coil, I constructed an off grid water heater / heat exchanger / space heater.

Important to note:
- Notice that this is an ""open"" system. Meaning that I made sure to leave a vent hole to prevent any pressure buildup.
- This system is not for drinking or cooking, as the ammo can and other components are definitely not food grade rated. I designed this as an experimental heater only.
- Once the water became hot enough, I made sure to remove the copper coil from the fire, to ensure that the temperature tolerances of the hoses and fittings would not be exceeded.
- And of course this is a prototype, meaning that it's not perfect, but something I've been working to develop further.
- The copper obviously isn't designed to be set directly in fire, but I simply wanted to see if the concept of heating with copper was possible. Now my goal is find a way to shield the copper from the flames in order to protect it from degradation.

For ages I’ve been thinking about doing a video analyzing time travel in fiction and doing a comparison of different fictional time travels – some do use wormholes, some relativistic/faster than light travel with time dilation, some closed timelike curves, some have essentially “magic” or no consistent rules that make any sense, or TARDIS's, or whatever. This video is an explanation of how time travel functions in different popular movies, books, & shows – not how it works “under the hood"", but how it causally affects the perspective of characters’ timelines (who has free will? can you change things by going back to the past or forwards into the future?). In particular, I explain Ender's Game, Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Primer, Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, Back to the Future, Groundhog Day, Looper, the video game “Braid”, and Lifeline.

Lyrics : Ayase
Translated by Konnie Aoki(https://twitter.com/koniaoki)

Ah, so what a scene, let's do another toast to confine
Match a city, overflowing laughing voices are
Pretended fabrications of a lie, blinded eye, deception
I'm trying not to go mad

Could a, could an aroma come and feed the brain in tune
With stimulation, reawaken inclinations
Don't know who's gonna go there today, I wonder

If I kept trying then, what can I, that cannot be done
On to the world, what can I, that cannot be done
Looking in those dark little eyes, I decide
I need to not once let your tear fall beneath

Get out to find it now, don't ever let go
The brighter future knows to reach it
Even when the world is caught and full of wrong
Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once
No, I cannot be hurting no one
I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now
Woken to resume my need to stay the real me

So what a scene, here's to another safely passed time
Masking every new bad rumor flowing in the city
Feel the lie, feel the lie, release to turn a blind eye
Choking on their own hysteria

Marching with an innocence, they proceed
To a location echoing the sound of feet skipping and
Feeling high, feeling high, memories of a lasting flavor
The other side's insanity

Can you call the ""standard good"" a living at all
And can ""nobody feeling sadder"" be a living at all
How is a straighter path you could see a living at all
So let's imagine going ""no mistake"" as living at all

And I don't wanna live as you'd assume, be saying it's right
And artificially be living and you're saying it's right
I don't know what I'll be, and to believe this, I wonder
Want to know the truth, what I'm inside and under
Oh, spill me the tale
Oh, spill me the tale

Still, we reside inside a dry confusing big world
I make a wish alone
Believe it, I just wanna be with you forever
Give me hope to be just smiling with you again

The skipping beating in my heart
Is shaking me within, and begins to shout
""Now you got to move, go make the way”

I will rise to prove the fragile little ""myself""
Go bite into my own and reach it
Even when the world is caught, and full of wrong
Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once
No, I cannot see nobody cry
I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now
Woken to resume my need to stay the real me

I'm gonna keep ya from danger, there are too many
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running for you
I will overcome what is residing for you

Content warnings are in the launcher for each game but I kind of speed past a few, apologies for that.  Deconstructeam games have a tendency to be emotionally stirring or viscerally brutal or some combination of the two.  Expect intense language, body horror, and some real interesting storytelling."

LYRICS:

Burn down my home
my memory's hardened in the brightest chrome
good times escape
while every mistake seems to be caught on tape

I will go rolling fast arms out in the rain
feel momentum building to lift off ground like an airplane
love ties you down to the pains
a billion eyes are watchin, fossilized they see what remains, remains

gave up this town
what waste are we left with when its boiled down
shine light on me
your image reflected is all you'll ever see

I will go rolling fast arms out in the rain
feel momentum building to lift off ground like an airplane
love ties you down to the pains
a billion eyes are watchin, fossilized they see what remains, remains

hic est optimus cantus in cosmō

in viā longa iter fēcimus
subitō effulsit daemon

dum dīxit

cantum optimum in cosmō mī dētis
sunt negantēs jam ēsī

ad meum fratrem
spexī, ac spexit ad mē
et dīximus
certissimē

et cecinimus rem
qua imprīmis mentēs
advenet forte nostrōs
cantio optima in cosmō
fuit cantio optima in cosmō

oc’lōs meōs aspice, facile ‘st vīsū
est sīc fātō, nōn rīsō,
semel inde bis, ergo
it postea bis terque

semel in centum aut mīlle annōrum
quum dat lūcem sōl
ac lūna dat pernox
tum viride crēscunt

nīl attinet ut dīcam
bestia erat stupīta
submīsit ira ad modum
ejus caudae

rogāvit nōs
‘angelī, nōnnē?’
negāvimus
‘hominēs modo!’

nunc cosmī optimus cantus est non
sed sīc laudās dāmus
memorāmus optimum cantus haud
sed laudās clāmāmus
cosmī optimae cantiōnis
cosmī optimus cantus fuit
cantus optimus fuit esto
optimus in ūniversō

FULL CREDITS BELOW:
Written and Performed by Christiaan Van Vuuren.
Animated by Connor Van Vuuren.
Recorded and Mixed by Alex Mills at Song Zu.
Backing Track is 'Payday' by Jason Farnham: https://youtu.be/-96SMUqYA1k

FULL LYRICS BELOW:

VERSE 1:
In Australia we've got deadly animals a plenty.
We've got funnel web spiders who'll murder you and your family.
Under every second rock is a red back spider.
And they’ll kill ya just cause, I dunno, they're bored or whatever.

We got invisible brown snakes who'll bite you on the foot,
And you’ll be dead in seven minutes, like that, kaput.
We've got the world's deadliest creatures all over the place.
We've got magpies who'll steal the eyeballs from your face -

But at least we don't have AR-15's.

VERSE 2:
We've got great white sharks who'll ascend from the deep,
And rip ya in half with their razor sharp teeth.
We've got salt water crocs who'll death-roll you to death,
and sea-snakes who'll gladly snatch your last breath. 

We've got a blue ringed octopus no bigger than this,
that just sits around in rock pools waiting to kill kids.
And even the platypus, a cute beaver-duck thing,
has got a spur on it’s ankle that’ll kill ya in one sting. 

But at least we don't have AR-15's.
And at least they can't end up in the hands of psychopathic teens.

VERSE 3:
We've got stonefish and stingrays and sea-urchins and shit,
and hectic fucken homicidal box jellyfish,
and these Jellyfish they aren’t even sentient beings,
they don’t even really do stuff or know about things. 

They just float around on the whim of the currents,
being pointless non-cognitive murderous cunts.
And if that weren't enough in terms of natural hazards,
here in Australia the sun causes cancer.

But at least we don't have AR-15's.
And at least they can't end up in the hands of suicidal teens.
And at least we don't have an NRA, who pay millions of dollars every day, buying off politicians not to change old laws.

VERSE 4:
We got bull sharks, cone shells, salt water crocodiles.
Honey bees, european wasps, and blue ringed octopi's.
Death adders, blue bottles, red back spiders.
Tiger sharks, tiger snakes, and lizards that'll bite ya. 

We got Sea snakes, taipans, cassowaries, copperheads,
all the creatures of the land and sky and sea that want you dead.
Toadfish, stonefish, irukandgi jellyfish -
Bull ants, centipedes, and ticks that cause paralysis. 

But thank fuck we don't have AR-15's.
And thank fuck they can't end up in the hands psychopathic suicidal teens. And thank fuck we don't have an NRA, who pay millions of dollars every day, buying off politicians not to change some law. 

A law that was written 200 years ago,
in a time when it took three minutes to reload,
a single round of ammunition, and we knew nothing about depression,
and you couldn't fire 45 rounds in sixty seconds.

And there wasn't even such a thing as automatic weapons.
And there weren't thirty one mass-shootings monthly…
but what would I know cause I'm from another country."
