Details on what happened and what will happen are below:

After some investigation, it seems like my 360's graphics card is failing.  At the moment, I can start the console, and then it dies after a few minutes regardless of what I do, so it's pretty much dead.  I've been wanting a modded 360 for quite a while now but lack the resources to install custom firmware on one myself (although the old one also had a disc drive I flashed on my own), so I'm thinking I'll buy a modded 360 with a bigger hard drive (since this one has a puny 20GB HDD).  If all goes well, I should have it up and running in about two weeks, but I'll have to move on to another (probably short) game in the meantime.  On the bright side, having an updated and modded 360 will mean being able to play all 360 games, including Trouble in Paradise, and play modded original Xbox games, which I had a huge idea for years ago that I really want to execute one day.  Lots of appreciation to the 360 that lasted me well over a decade, though.

I knew this playthrough would have a decent amount of life and death, but I didn't think it'd extend into this sort of thing."
