"rLr5kSrGtEo","Let's Play ""Baldur's Gate"" Part 001 - Choppy Mouse Movements, Ho!","aulddragon","2023-10-14","2011-08-16","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLr5kSrGtEo/hqdefault.jpg","Let's Play the first of the Infinity Engine AD&D games: ""Baldur's Gate""!

We start out with character creation, which I don't go into as much depth as I did in the SSI games. To speed everything up, I pregenerated Elmindreda, the character I will be using in BG.

Unfortunately, mouse laggyness and video problems in episode 2 get the better of me. Looks like I'll have to investigate some other recording methods besides Camstudio (which works fine for old games, but not so much for newer ones). Hopefully I'll get everything worked out this weekend and I can get some more episodes done for next week."

About the Game:
Play an RPG with meaningful, world-altering choices, unique and memorable companions, and a new perspective on morality. Tyranny casts you as the arbiter of law in a world devastated by war and conquered by a despot. Will you work inside the system or try to dismantle it‚Ä¶ and will it be for the glory of Kyros, for the good of the world, or for your own ambition?

From Obsidian Entertainment, the team behind Pillars of Eternity, Fallout: New Vegas, and South Park: The Stick of Truth, Tyranny is a classic-styled RPG with a new and original story, shaped and molded by your actions. The very layout of the world will be altered by your decisions as you choose sides, make allies and enemies, and fight for your own vision of law and order in an immersive and reactive story.

In Tyranny, the grand war between good and evil is over ‚Äì and the forces of evil, led by Kyros the Overlord, have won. The Overlord‚Äôs merciless armies dominate the face of the world, and its denizens must find their new roles within the war-torn realm... even as discord begins to rumble among the ranks of Kyros‚Äô most powerful Archons.

Players will experience the new world order under Overlord in a reactive role-playing game (RPG), interacting with the populace as a powerful Fatebinder in the Overlord‚Äôs forces -- roaming the lands to inspire loyalty or fear as they bring control to the last holdouts of the Tiers.

Caves of Qud is a colossal and colossally weird post-apocalyptic roguelike. This game has been in development for a very long time and I've been thinking about doing a series on it basically since the channel began. Now seems like a good time for a long, weird adventure, so let's get in here and try not to die before we even get to the caves.

Everyone wanted it so badly that Square Enix re-released the game with HD graphics: Final Fantasy X! Okay so the boys playing this game isn't exactly a secret to anybody, but they're still excited, especially Tek. After some obligatorily tedious cutscenes, we see our protagonist (named by Tek) showing off his Blitzball skills, when something interrupts the game. And you thought baseball rainouts were bad!

This episode covers the intro cutscene a few times (for good measure?) then introduces our protagonist (Pantleg) and the very most basic elements of combat in Zanarkand.

It's finally time, you guys! Eternal Sonata (the true story of the life and times of Polish composer Frederic Francois Chopin) is one of Vasco's favorite games of all time, and one that Tek historically hates with a passion. For some reason Tek has finally relented and the parade of meaningless cutscenes can begin! Today's episode really sets the pace and tone of the story, and really only covers the most basic aspects of combat, but this JRPG will only get better from here!

This episode covers the Path to Tenuto and arriving and Tenuto (plus relevant cutscenes) in Chapter 1: Raindrops.

Game Description:

Earth is burning. Striking from beyond known space, a race of terrifying machines have begun their destruction of the human race. As Commander Shepard, an Alliance Marine, your only hope for saving mankind is to rally the civilizations of the galaxy and launch one final mission to take back the Earth.This item does not come with a gun or controller accessory.

Mass Effect 3 is a Role-playing Game (RPG) / Third-Person Shooter hybrid set in a Science Fiction universe. Mass Effect 3 is the third game in the popular Mass Effect series, and is rumored to be the final installment. In it players continue the adventures of Commander Shepard utilizing extreme character customization which is the hallmark feature of the series. Additional features include: the ability to import decisions from both of the previous games into the new game, ownership/play of previous games not required, customizable weapons, improved mobility and melee combat, many returning characters (if they were not killed off in previous imported games), an improved cover system that allows for more action, compatibility with the Kinect Sensor for Xbox 360 and more.

The Final Chapter in the Mass Effect Trilogy

Not everyone will survive. An ancient alien race, known only as ""Reapers,"" has launched an all-out invasion leaving nothing but a trail of destruction in their wake. Earth has been taken, the galaxy is on the verge of total annihilation, and you are the only one who can stop them. The price of failure is extinction. You are Commander Shepard, a character that you can forge in your own image. You determine how events will play out, which planets to explore, and whom to form alliances with as you rally a force to eliminate the Reaper threat once and for all. How you wage this war is completely up to you: go into combat with guns blazing or use cover to plan a more tactical assault. Utilize your squad to full effect or take a lone wolf approach. Rain death from a distance or go toe-to-toe with enemies using devastating melee attacks. Mass Effect 3 will react to each decision you make as you play through a truly unique experience of your own creation.

Rain World is a game about desperately trying to survive in a broken ecosystem, but at least you get to be an adorable slugcat while doing it! Can we find our way back to our nomadic family before we are consumed by giant terrifying monsters or swept away by torrential downpours? No, probably not.

The Trolley Problem is a classic philosophical thought experiment where there are entities on two train tracks, one of which is about to be hit by a trolley. Given the option, would you act and pull the lever to divert the trolley, causing it to miss the original victim at the expense of whatever's on track two?

"I3aTzbUPktk","Commander Keen 7 : The Keys of Krodacia [100% all levels] (MS-Dos, 2006)","dosdaysareover","2023-10-14","2018-08-05","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I3aTzbUPktk/hqdefault.jpg","""Commander Keen: The Keys of Krodacia"" is the first episode of the unofficial ""The Universe Is Toast"" trilogy, and is often referred to as Keen 7. Full playthrough of the game (All levels finished).

The game is a fan mod created using the Keen4 engine and was released in June 2006, and then re-released in 2009 with new music, additional content and bug fixes.

The story begins immediately where Keen 6 left off. Upon returning to Earth, Billy asks Molly if it would be alright to browse through Mortimer's room, as there could be clues to Mortimer's plans. Persuading her that preventing the destruction of the Universe was more important than her brother's privacy, Billy finds a video tape on Mortimer's desk with a label in Standard Galactic Alphabet. The tape contains a message from Mortimer, giving Billy a clue that the Universal Toaster Cannon is being built on the planet Krodacia.

On Krodacia, Commander Keen finds a gigantic structure with only one entrance at the bottom, locked by seven keys. It's up to Keen to find the seven keys to get into Mortimer's base, and stop the Universal Toaster Cannon!

The story continues in Dead in the Desert, click here for the full gameplay video of Commander Keen 8: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX7jfh8863E&t=1940s

https://store.steampowered.com/app/865610/Backbone/
It takes a certain kind of person to take on the greatest evils of the world. A keen intellect. Relentless courage. An unstoppable desire to see justice done.But you? You‚Äôre just trying to make rent.You‚Äôre not special. You‚Äôre not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet.Get to work, detective. Backbone is a post-noir roleplaying detective adventure, in which you step into the shoes of raccoon private investigator, Howard Lotor, and explore dystopian Vancouver, BC, beautifully rendered in high resolution pixel art.
After years of small-time cases, lonely evenings, and just barely scraping by, Howard Lotor is swept into a job quite unlike any other before it. What starts as a menial case slowly unravels into something much darker, pitting Howard against the oppressive, systemic power hierarchies of the City itself.Backbone's gameplay is a modern take on the classic point-and-click adventure, featuring stealth, exploration, and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs.As Howard, you will:
‚Ä¢ Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth
‚Ä¢ Explore both flourishing and decaying districts of a now walled-off Vancouver‚Ä¢ Uncover clues and collect evidence
‚Ä¢ Solve puzzles and sneak around
‚Ä¢ Be a raccoonPost-noir dystopiaBackbone‚Äôs Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It‚Äôs a tale of a cold and existentialist world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better.
Stunning visuals
The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling city to life.
Evocative and unforgettable soundtrack
An original soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape. You‚Äôve never heard dystopian doom jazz quite like this."

Inscryption is a roguelite card battler from the maker of Pony Island, which is to say that it is definitely not just a roguelite card battler. It also simulates the greatest horror a card gamer can encounter: being stuck playing against an edgy weirdo who takes the game VERY seriously.

---------- DETAILS ----------
This playthrough was recorded LIVE on Twitch. As such, Adam is speaking with chat throughout. Videos without chat will be listed as 'Youtube Exclusive'. This is the ENTIRE playthrough, so there will be some episodes in which not much happens, that's just the nature of unedited RimWorld.

*No Pause - Adam is using a mod that disables pause in every portion of the game. This means it is impossible for him to pause with a  key press and the game will not pause during events or trade, making things much more difficult.

** Losing is Fun set to +500% is the hardest difficulty in unmodded RimWorld

***Randy is a Rimworld storyteller who is super RNG. Sometimes he is super easy, and other times he is the hardest thing in the game.

**** Lost Tribe is a scenario in which you begin with 5 tribals, some supplies, and 3 random pets. This scenario has very slow research by default.

More about Going Medieval (from Steam):

STAKE YOUR CLAIM
In the world of Going Medieval, dark age society is on its knees. At the end of the 14th century, 95% of the global population has perished due to rampant plague.

Eventually, survivors emerge from society‚Äôs ashes, and it‚Äôs now up to you to help them settle in a dangerous new land reclaimed by nature. Build your people a home, help shape their lives, and protect them from animals, bandits, and other dangers in a lawless post-calamity age.

BUILD YOUR FORTRESS
Design, build and expand your settlement from a small wooden hut into a colossal stone castle. With simple-to-use 3D terrain tools you can create the perfect stronghold, from winding underground caverns to sprawling multi-story forts.

DEFEND YOUR COLONY
This harsh new world is rife with external threats, but you can give your colonists the upper hand in battle by building impenetrable defences and traps. Research, craft and equip weapons and gear so that they can fight back against unrelenting waves of attackers.

PROTECT YOUR VILLAGERS
Your colonists have more than just raids to contend with. They need protection from starvation and the elements, so it‚Äôs essential to stock up on supplies and build shelter to keep them fed and warm. Maintain your villagers‚Äô emotional states, as their moods are affected if their needs and wants aren‚Äôt met.

SHAPE YOUR STORY
Grow the population of your settlement by helping out strangers in dangerous situations, or by taking in like-minded travelers. Your villagers have personal histories and agendas, and you can get to know them by observing their behaviour and relationships with others."

Buy HyperRogue on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/342610/HyperRogue/

Basically every game in this series is a game I got a code for.

Game Description:

A tactical puzzle/roguelike on a hyperbolic plane.

You are a lone adventurer in a strange, non-Euclidean world. Gather as much treasure as you can before the nasty monsters get you. Explore about 50 different lands, each with its own unique treasures, enemies, and terrain obstacles. Your quest is to find the legendary treasure, the Orbs of Yendor. Collect one of them to win! Or just ignore your quest and collect smaller treasures.

The twist is the unique, unusual geometry of the world: it is one of just few games which takes place on the hyperbolic plane. Witness a grid composed of hexagons and heptagons, straight lines which seem to be parallel, but then they diverge and never cross, triangles whose angles add up to less than 180 degrees, how extremely unlikely is it to reach the same place twice due to practically infinite size of the world (centillions of locations in just 700 steps from the starting point), and how the world seems to be rotated when you do return. All this matters for the gameplay. The game is inspired by the roguelike genre (although in a very minimalist way), works of M. C. Escher, and by puzzle games such as Deadly Rooms of Death.

HyperRogue can be played for free from its website. The Steam version adds online achievements, online leaderboards, trading cards, and convenience. Also, as the game is constantly updated, the Steam version includes the newest features, such as new lands with new mechanics, or new game modes -- see Gallery for the current differences.

For *more old games revived*, check out this playlist: https://gamerzakh.com/202X
In #202X is a series where I check out an old game that has been brought back to life in a recent year. Remastered, modded, or overhauled. This is the past revived and made playable for today's gamers.

*The graphics mod guide I used here* as a base BUT made some notable changes:
https://github.com/Tyler799/Morrowind-2020/blob/master/Morrowind_2020.md

NOTES
- When available, pick the version of mods compatible with Morrowind Rebirth

- Better Night Sky (I preferred this night sky mod compared to others)
https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44717

- Apel's Rain Replacer (Not necessary but rain seemed a bit hard to see for me)
https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42555

- NO Per-pixel Lighting in MGE XE (Lights just seem to look better overall with this OFF)

- Morrowind Rebirth 5.2 (Install first to have other mods take priority, install last to have Rebirth take priority)
https://www.moddb.com/mods/morrowind-rebirth/news/release-morrowind-rebirth-52

- Grass for Rebirth 5.2 (The latest version of this is what limits the Rebirth version you can use. IF there is a newer version of this grass then you can use a newer version of Rebirth)
https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48630

- Skip Patch for Purists (Conflicts with Rebirth)

- Skip ALL Tree mods EXCEPT Vurt's Bitter Coast trees which I prefer even though there are a few glitches (Most conflict with Rebirth that brings its own trees) You can skip all tree mods if you want

- Skip Graphic Herbalism (Conflicts with Rebirth)

Hi! My name is Christopher Odd and I‚Äôve been playing video games on the internet for a few years. I really enjoy a variety of games but generally lean towards games with a unique and engaging story (Bioshock, The Witcher, etc), strategy/roguelike games (XCOM 2 War of the Chosen, Darkest Dungeon, etc), and RPGs (Dark Souls, Dragon Age, etc). Of course, I am always looking for great indie games too!

Hades is a god-like rogue-like dungeon crawler that combines the best aspects of Supergiant's critically acclaimed titles, including the fast-paced action of Bastion, the rich atmosphere and depth of Transistor, and the character-driven storytelling of Pyre.
BATTLE OUT OF HELL
As the immortal Prince of the Underworld, you'll wield the powers and mythic weapons of Olympus to break free from the clutches of the god of the dead himself, while growing stronger and unraveling more of the story with each unique escape attempt.
UNLEASH THE FURY OF OLYMPUS
The Olympians have your back! Meet Zeus, Athena, Poseidon, and many more, and choose from their dozens of powerful Boons that enhance your abilities. There are thousands of viable character builds to discover as you go.

BEFRIEND GODS, GHOSTS, AND MONSTERS
A fully-voiced cast of colorful, larger-than-life characters is waiting to meet you! Grow your relationships with them, and experience thousands of unique story events as you learn about what's really at stake for this big, dysfunctional family.
BUILT FOR REPLAYABILITY
New surprises await each time you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld, whose guardian bosses will remember you. Use the powerful Mirror of Night to grow permanently stronger, and give yourself a leg up the next time you run away from home.
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
Permanent upgrades mean you don't have to be a god yourself to experience the exciting combat and gripping story. Though, if you happen to be one, crank up the challenge and get ready for some white-knuckle action that will put your well-practiced skills to the test.


SIGNATURE SUPERGIANT STYLE
The rich, atmospheric presentation and unique melding of gameplay and narrative that's been core to Supergiant's games is here in full force: spectacular hand-painted environments and a blood-pumping original score bring the Underworld to life.

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

Speedrunning can be intimidating to get started with, but it doesn't have to be! Learn just how easy it can be by utilizing semi-blind races -- races of games you've played before, but never tried to speedrun -- and (hopefully) find a few laughs along the way. Tune in live on Thursdays at 7pm Eastern at twitch.tv/gamesdonequick to race alongside the hosts! This edition of The First Step aired on August 13th, 2020.

This is a full playthrough including the real ENDING. There are definitely some jump scares and I would recommend setting the vibe as much as you can. Lights off, headphones on, extra diapers. The ending is very tricky to figure out and I almost gave up. I got some starting steps here: http://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/2dhvd4/pt_solved/ After a couple steps, I had to figure it out on my own. There may be some randomness involves. It seems the internet isn't even sure exactly so let me know if you're able to replicate it.

Buy Yes, Your Grace on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1115690/Yes_Your_Grace/

Basically every game in this series is a game I got a code for.

Game Description:

These are troubling times, Your Grace. The petitioners‚Äô petty matters exceed our limited resources, to say nothing of the war. A careful balance must be struck. Your throne awaits.

THE GAME

In this kingdom management RPG, petitioners will arrive in the throne room each turn to ask for your advice and assistance. Decide whether to help them with their problems, or to conserve resources for more important matters. Remember: supplies are limited, and not everyone has the kingdom‚Äôs best interests at heart...

FEATURES

Listen to petitioners each turn and decide who needs your support.

Aid your family with their personal problems and decide upon their fate.

Hire Generals, Witches and Hunters to aid your efforts.

Prepare for battle and make alliances by satisfying the whims of lords and kings.

Follow the stories of the quirky and determined characters that visit your halls.

THE WORLD

Yes, Your Grace tells a tale of Davern, a medieval kingdom ruled by King Eryk. The game is set in a fictional world where monsters and arcane practices inspired by Slavic folklore are the order of the day. Villagers will ask for your help with various problems, from monsters attacking the village to a lack of places to relax and enjoy themselves. Some will bring humour to your throne room and some will present you with difficult choices. Your family is important too, and throughout your time as King, you will have to support them in their struggles.

You will face lords with a variety of personalities; you will need their support in order to win an upcoming battle, but some may ask you to perform dirty deeds to cement the alliance. One thing is clear: It won‚Äôt be easy to keep everyone happy..."

Buy Pathologic Classic HD on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/384110/Pathologic_Classic_HD/

Game Description:

The original Indie Cult Classic returns fully restored, and more evocative than ever.

Pathologic Classic HD is the Definitive Edition of the original Cult Classic Psychological First-Person Survival game. The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir‚Äîbut something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or‚Äîfailing that‚Äîan explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third‚Äîand last‚Äîoutsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past.

On the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three ""heroes."" Dig deeper, however, and you‚Äôll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic you‚Äôll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone else‚Äôs pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague. Become witness to the miasma of horror as the plague begins to overcome the town.


Brand New in-house English script: For the first time ever, the game has cast off the major issue that had previously disallowed international audiences from accessing it.

Brand New Voice-overs.

New content: A certain amount of text that had previously been cut from the international version of the game have now been restored
Updated textures and higher resolutions support.

New visual effects.

Newly Included Fan-Made Polish translation: thanks to the hard work and generosity of Jakub Derdziak & Aldona Derdziak.
An Italian translation, kindly donated to us by the original translators of the game, Stefano Gaburri and Claudio Todeschini.

An indie cult classic.

12 days in a plague-ridden town. Time is running, and mostly it‚Äôs running out; numerous events unfold, whether you‚Äôre there to witness them or not.

70+ hours of real-time gameplay without grinding or repetitive quests. As time goes by, more and more things happen, inviting you to participate and change the course of events.

3 playable characters with 3 unique storylines. The Bachelor‚Äôs, the Haruspex‚Äôs, and the Changeling‚Äôs plots are interconnected, but every side of the trilemma is represented separately via unique events, quests, dialogues, and subplots.

The plot is critically acclaimed and often regarded as the high point of the game. It‚Äôs not just about the fate of the dying town‚Äîit‚Äôs about an ideological conflict, represented by a multitude of characters and factions, each with their own idea of what life, death, and miracles are.

An open-world game. While the plot is there to grab you, the town has no artificial boundaries: you are free to explore it from day one, carving out your own story.

Survival is tough. The dying town demands that you constantly keep an eye on your status, maintaining a full belly and decent immunity. That will require tough choices.

Communicate, barter, rob, or steal. There are many ways to acquire your bare necessities, each of them with its own benefits and drawbacks.

The atmosphere of bleakness and despair without cartoonish evil or bad guys. Playtime is over‚Äîthere will be no jump scares or simple solutions. You will have to do it the hard way.

REVIEWS

‚Äú.....Pathologic is the single best and most important game that you‚Äôve never played.‚Äù
Rock, Paper, Shotgun

‚Äú....you will be psychologically and emotionally tested like you never have before‚Äù

ABOUT: Not Tonight

Person of European Heritage #112: Welcome to Relocation Block B, your new home. Your designated role is 'Bouncer'. Work hard, stay out of trouble, and we might let you stay in the UK.

In an alternative Britain where Brexit talks have collapsed, an extreme far-right government has taken power. Citizens of European heritage have been rounded up and exiled. Forced out of your previous life, you find yourself in the midst of a booming gig economy, fighting to scrape by and return to the city you call home.

Not Tonight is a post-Brexit management game, fusing a time-pressure RPG with a politically charged story where every decision matters. Will you join the resistance and fight the regime -- or keep your head down and hope that one day this will all be a distant memory?

Man the doors of pubs, clubs, festivals and parties, finding work via the BouncR app
Check IDs, manage guestlists, and stop revellers from becoming unruly
Upgrade your apartment, bouncer and equipment to better prepare yourself for the future
Decide what lengths you'll go to in order to survive in a Britain on the verge of collapse

ABOUT: Prison Architect

Build and Manage A Maximum Security Prison.

Build and manage a Maximum Security Prison. As the sun casts it‚Äôs early morning rays on a beautiful patch of countryside the clock starts ticking. You‚Äôve got to crack on and build a holding cell to detain the job¬≠ lot of maximum security prisoners that are trundling to your future prison on their yellow bus. As your workmen lay the last brick you don‚Äôt have a moment to let them rest as they need to get started on the first proper cell block so you can make room for the next prisoner intake. Once they‚Äôve all got a place to lay their weary heads the fun can really start.

You‚Äôll need a canteen, infirmary and a guard room, oh, and don‚Äôt forget to plumb in a toilet, or things will get messy, but what about a workout area? Or solitary confinement cells? Or an execution chamber?

Inspired by Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress and Theme Hospital and with over 1 million players having spent time inside, Prison Architect is the world‚Äôs best lock-¬≠em-¬≠up.

Story Mode

Prison Architect opens with the story of Edward, a man facing the electric chair for committing a crime of passion. This is followed by four additional chapters focusing on different characters and aspects of prison life. From Mafia Dons to power-crazed senators, Prison Architect has them all! To bring these characters to life, Introversion teamed up with award winning professional writer Chris Hastings, producing an enthralling tale of corruption and human misery set against the background of the modern prison industrial complex.

Escape Mode

Finished your supermax? Got guard dogs roving every corridor and prisoners eating out of your hand? Now you can live the horror by firing up escape mode and play as a prisoner bent on getting out of dodge.

Dig a tunnel, go for the armoury or start a riot and slip out in the chaos, it‚Äôs entirely up to you! Figure out how to escape from your own creation, or hit the random button and load one of the 12,000 prisons created by the steam co

Every once in a while a game comes out that is so different and so unique it changes my perspective on indie gaming.  This game is one of those.  You only have one hour to live, but your life will shape the future of everyone else in the world, for generations to come.  You are born a baby and potentially grow up to be an old man/woman...but there's no telling what might happen during your life...

ABOUT: One Hour One Life

This game is about playing one small part in a much larger story. You only live an hour, but time and space in this game is infinite. You can only do so much in one lifetime, but the tech tree in this game will take hundreds of generations to fully explore. This game is also about family trees. Having a mother who takes care of you as a baby, and hopefully taking care of a baby yourself later in life. And your mother is another player. And your baby is another player. Building something to use in your lifetime, but inevitably realizing that, in the end, what you build is not for YOU, but for your children and all the countless others that will come after you.

Proudly using your grandfather's ax, and then passing it on to your own grandchild as the end of your life nears. And looking at each life as a unique story. I was this kid born in this situation, but I eventually grew up. I built a bakery near the wheat fields. Over time, I watched my grandparents and parents grow old and die. I had some kids of my own along the way, but they are grown now... and look at my character now! She's an old woman. What a life passed by in this little hour of mine. After I die, this life will be over and gone forever. I can be born again, but I can never live this unique story again. Everything's changing. I'll be born as a different person in a different place and different time, with another unique story to experience in the next hour...

More about Oxygen Not Included (from Steam):

In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you‚Äôll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving...

Just make sure you don't forget to breathe.

Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive
Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.


It‚Äôs Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations:
Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.

Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics:
Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.

Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations:
Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.

Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations
Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.

Always Keep Yourself Breathing:
Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.

Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling
Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you‚Äôre clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts.

Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds:Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds:
Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them!

More about Meeple Station (from Steam):

DISCLAIMER: Meeple Station is in active development and is therefore subject to constant change. Nothing is representative of final gameplay. We update as often as possible so during it's Alpha state, There-Will-Be-Bugs. We try our best to smash them as soon as we're aware of them so most bugs are fixed shortly after patch-days. We'd appreciate if you gave the in-game bug report button a nice hard punch and let us know if you encounter any during your play - it helps us quickly get them fixed. We always endeavor greatly to not break saves- because that's annoying, but it's not always avoidable. Thankfully we've only had to do that once so far. So sorry bout that one, but ya' can't win 'em all.
So What Is Meeple Station?

So What Is Meeple Station?

Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee!
Meeple need things to live!

Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire.

Trade!

At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets.
Fight off lazy pirates!

Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers.

We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem.

The RLCraft Modpack for Minecraft by Shivaxi looked interesting, so I wanted to give it a shot. This is RLCraft Ep 1 (Ep 1 may also be the only episode, we'll see if there's interest in more) Nonetheless, RLCraft is hardcore, unforgiving and brutal, but it's a lot of fun. If there's enough support for it, I'll make episode 2.

What is RLCraft:
RLCraft is a hardcore realism modpack for Minecraft (Minus all the mythical creatures...) RLCraft makes Minecraft incredibly difficult and you'll see that here, in episode 1.

(1991) [MS-DOS]","Dosgamert","2023-10-14","2017-05-14","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ssT4X0M3ZVU/hqdefault.jpg","Keen 6: Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter! takes place some time after ""Goodbye, Galaxy!"", and is a major change from the normal plot of the games. The story of the game occurs under the idea that Mortimer McMire is attempting to distract Keen from his plotting to destroy the universe, which would have ultimately occurred in The Universe Is Toast. Mortimer convinces a dim-witted race of creatures called the Bloogs, who dwell on Fribbulus Xax, a planet in a faraway corner of the Galaxy, to kidnap Keen's babysitter Molly in exchange for the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV.

This game runs on an engine that is slightly updated from ""Goodbye Galaxy""'s, and utilizes more capabilities for slanted platforms and other new features including updated sound effects and new music. Keen must collect various items all across the planet to progress in the game, which provides a new mechanic.

The game is, however, famous for the abnormally large number of glitches present during gameplay. In certain parts of the game, Keen can fall through walls and platforms, and also present is the famous Impossible Bullet glitch. In addition, saving in certain locations can freeze or crash the game, and even warp Keen to a different location...

Unfortunately, this game is no longer legally available anywhere to purchase, unless bought second-hand. Although the other five episodes have been made available for a US$5 download, and Keen 1, Keen 4, Keen Dreams, and a demo version of this episode are available for free shareware distribution, this game is not legally downloadable anywhere at present.

Having previously freed the Council Members from their exile in the Shadowlands and having had them activate the Oracle (see Keen 4 Story), Keen learned that the Shikadi are in the Korath system and are planning to destroy the Milky Way with their Armageddon Machine, the Omegamatic.

Keen rapidly heads to Korath III, where the Omegamatic is being constructed in orbit around the planet. Once there, he sneaks aboard the lower floors by docking with a ventilation duct near the main exhaust.

Once onboard, Keen goes nuts, shooting all sorts of robots, defenses, and creatures, including the Shikadi. His aim is first to make it past the lower floors to the main deck, then to destroy each of the four machines protecting the main elevator shaft. (Each of which is protected by a defense tunnel.) This grants access to the second elevator, allowing Keen to use it to travel to the upper deck where he may then attack the core of the Omegamatic, the Quantum Explosion Dynamo.

It belongs to the second keen serie ""Goodbye Galaxy!"". This serie includes also another keen game, The Armageddon Machine, which is not shareware. Secret of the Oracle is shareware and can be downloaded from the downloads page. This game is actually worth to download since it has better gameplay and graphics than the other old versions.

Billy has been working on a new invention in this episode. His latest invention is the Photachyon Tranceiver, a radio that can reviece signals from anywhere in the galaxy. After playing around with his new invention, he suddenly hears a strange message: ""brrzzz ... giggg ... oment of great triumph ... frzzt ... ast the Milky Way will be ... huzzzzz ... terly destroyed ... pyuneeeeeeg ... can stop us now. We will remake the galaxy in the name of the Gannalech. Power to our race! power to the Shikadi!"" After zapping his parents, Billy heads to The Oracle of Gnosticus IV, who will help Billy with his mission.

But after arriving on Gnosticus IV he discovers that the Shikadi have already been there. The Shikadi seems to have kidnapped all the members of the council, and taken them all to the shadow lands in the west side of the planet. Sounds like a interesting mission for commander keen.
