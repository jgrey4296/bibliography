Welcome to my playthrough of We Happy Few, a survival action-adventure game from Compulsion Games. It takes place in the 1960s on the isolated island of Wellington Wells. During WW2, Germans occupied the town. After some horrible event, the Germans left the island and the inhabitants developed a drug called Joy. Now, 20 years later, almost everyone is pressured into taking Joy to forget what happened and keep up the delusion that everything is fine.

Welcome to my playthrough of We Happy Few, a survival action-adventure game from Compulsion Games. It takes place in the 1960s on the isolated island of Wellington Wells. During WW2, Germans occupied the town. After some horrible event, the Germans left the island and the inhabitants developed a drug called Joy. Now, 20 years later, almost everyone is pressured into taking Joy to forget what happened and keep up the delusion that everything is fine.
