Note to Subscribers: I know a lot of you have asked me to make a complete retrospective for the Elder Scrolls series, but I just couldn't do it. This video as it stands  took me four months to play through the games, write the script, and do the recording. I did consider doing a total Elder Scrolls vs. Dragon Age video-- but as soon as I began Oblivion after spending 110 hours on Skyrim, I knew it wasn't going to happen. I hope you enjoy this video anyway,"

It looks at the evolution of the video game western and tries to place these games in context with other Western media that inspired and surrounded them. It looks at them thematically, mechanically, and with a particular eye for what makes them special as a Western. SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.

Also, here's that link to the Red Dead Revolver history I found so helpful: https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/17/17986118/how-the-red-dead-franchise-began-angel-studios-capcom-rockstar

It looks at the arc of development from 1998-2020 that took Gordon Freeman from the popularizer of mouselook to the herald of virtual reality. It also covers Half-Life associated and adjacent games, like Portal 1 and 2, Source Multiplayer titles, and some iconic single-player mods. This is a remake of a video I'd done in 2013. That video has now been delisted in favor of this updated, tidier edition. A link to it has been provided below for anyone still curious, as well as download links for mods. Again, spoilers throughout.

It looks to how they interface with the Monomyth template as originally laid down in 1949 by Joseph Campbell in The Hero With a Thousand Faces, one game conforming exactly to it and the next game violently rejecting the entire premise. It also discusses how Campbell's monomyth influenced the philosophies of the Jedi and Sith more than George Lucas might care to admit. Spoilers throughout.

The video focuses on how much more open, free, and fun these games are than I was led to believe based on everything I ever heard of 'Git Gud'. Over the course of five hours, the video tries to figure out how the games support or detract from one another, the ways they're connected, and how a clumsy fool like me can find not only victory but comfort in their strange, sad little worlds.
