In this installment of SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we go over how a top speedrunner for Half-Life (and former world record holder), KaNanga, beats the game in 26 minutes. This run is brutally fast paced, utilizing the litany of options you have with Goldsource Engine (the Source Engine's predecessor) movement, such as bunnyhopping, air strafing, jumpbugs, edgebugs, and much more. In addition to that, this run contains some sizable skips: some as simple as climbing and jumping a barrier, and some as wild as clipping through solid walls.

In this installment of SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we go over how Alien: Isolation speedrun world record holder, xEB, beats the game in 22 minutes. This run utilizes some major sequence breaks, using one of the games only mechanics, crouching, to clip through walls (crouch clipping). In addition to that, most of the missions are skipped, and some other useful tech is used, such as silent running, letting you get past aliens without detection.

In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, I teach class how the world record holder for Super Mario Odyssey Any%, Tyron18, blazes through the game in under an hour (under 57 minutes to be exact!). This speedrun contains insanely tight movement, including things like clapfires, roll cancels, spinpounds, triple throws, rainbow spins, cap stalls, power vaults, and more! The run ALSO contains clips to go out-of-bounds, skips for 2D sections, and other crazy exploits and shenanigans.

This Control run is done by the world record holder Ashley93oBTW, who just shreds his way through the game and bosses in under 55 minutes. This run contains glitches that let him go out-of-bounds, clip through floors with objects, and pretty much just fly through the map.

In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we break down the Any% (No Major Glitches) speedrun of Hollow Knight, performed by the former world record holder, Lep. This run includes some glitches and skips, including using your Shade to skip parts of the map, hitting levers through floors, and a glitch that pretty much lets you get super speed (although its use is limited in this category as it's considered a major glitch in certain applications). This video serves as an explanation of the strategies used by Lep to beat Hollow Knight in around 30 minutes. Had to make sure that this speedrun was covered on the tomatoanus channel before Silksong released ;)

Yes, you read the title correctly. This is a speedrun to adopt a baby in Fallout: New Vegas. This speedrun is made possible by using a ton of mods that allow for such actions to be possible in the game. In this speedrun, we utilize several glitches, including one exploit that lets us fly across the map, getting XP to level up at a specific point, and also have things like going out- of-bounds to skip things. We do this very fast, very quick, very speedy.

In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we go over one of the greater challenges in HITMAN 3 speedrunning: beating the game (Season 3) with the Silent Assassin rating on every mission, all while never changing out of our starting suit (Suit Only). This run is done by the world record holder, HOUSEN, who demonstrates both a mastery and breadth of knowledge of the games mechanics, its exploits, and glitches, allowing him to beat all Season 3 missions in only five minutes. This is all before the Freelancer mode recently released, so particle boosts (with muffins of course) are still in the game!

In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we break down an Any% (No SLA) speedrun of Portal 2. This run is performed by Msushi, one of the top runners for this game. This run disallows saving and loading due to those features being able to easily break the game, and also disallows going out-of-bounds. What this run DOES include though, is tight movement (such as bunnyhopping), cutscene skips, glitches, exploits, and solving a lot of the chambers in just a few seconds. This video serves as an explanation of the strategies used by Msushi (and other speedrunners) to beat Portal 2 in under an hour.

#Portal2 #SourceEngine #Speedrun

Fullbright is more or less just increased brightness, and is something you can set up in the preference files of Portal 2. Fullbright makes it a lot easier for speedrunners to navigate dark levels, but Msushi mainly has it on for you at home since he can actually navigate the levels pretty decently in the dark. You're able to set up your preference files so that individual levels load with fullbright on, so that you don't need to go into any settings or anything when you load into dark levels.

5:08 - Your vertical velocity doesn't affect the speedlock, only your overall horizontal velocity.

12:24 - The Laser Switch Glitch (LSG) is actually what's described at 19:20, and just so happens to be often used on doors. The door thing itself is not LSG and doesn't really have a name.

12:34 - Ticks aren't the same as frames, they're a fixed interval of 1/60 of a second (0.0166s).

12:43 - This glitch isn't due to an overlap in the hitboxes, but rather a strange consequence of the fact that the door hitbox is entirely behind the portal.

13:51 - This glitch isn't related to the number of entities, but rather is a strange bug caused by a system implemented to prevent timing issues with buttons whose output is on a delay. See https://wiki.portal2.sr/Button_Glitch for details.

19:20 - LSG isn't caused by the portal decay and laser staying in place for a moment, but rather is caused by the laser receiver staying on for a short amount of time after the laser itself disappears.

1:00:30 - The funnel counter actually only goes up to 2 after he uncrouches again, since this glitch is really caused by ~changing~ whether you're crouched whilst standing still in a funnel. See https://wiki.portal2.sr/Crouch_Fly_Glitch for details."

DISCLAIMER: I’m aware of the fall damage explanation not being up to date with current knowledge. We were unaware of this info when making the video, mistakes happen :) I went to see how it would look with it trimmed out (you can cut stuff out of videos on YouTube after they're uploaded), but it made the whole section janky and not flow well, and I'd prefer to leave it in with the disclaimer here that the fall damage explanation is not accurate. Fall damage is based on distance between your starting height and landing height. With zips, you end up at heights around the same or above where you started, so no fall damage is taken in most cases.

So far on the tomatoanus channel, we’ve covered Sekiro, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, and Demon’s Souls. Now it’s time to bring it all home by covering Elden Ring in this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED. We worked together with seeker, world record holder for the Any% (Unrestricted) category, to bring you a video covering TWO runs of From Software’s newest installment: Any% (Restricted) and Any% (Unrestricted). In this video, we first go over the Restricted run, followed by the Unrestricted run, explaining all the tricks along the way, including easy boss strats, warping all around the map (wrong warps), the infamous zip glitch, and much much more. This video serves as an explanation of the strategies seeker uses to beat the game in both 25 minutes and 5 minutes.

In this speedrun explained, we break down an Any% speedrun of the original BioShock (sorry, not the remastered version). This run is performed by KPCzombie, one of the top runners for the game. This run includes ways to skip doors, cutscenes, and even entire levels. Sorry, but there’s no ADAM duplication glitch used in this run! This video serves as an explanation of the strategies used by KPC to beat BioShock in under 29 minutes.

#BioShock #Speedrun

The first fling in the run, which saves ten seconds, is specifically called “YOLO fling” since it was a known about fling, but it wasn’t done in runs due to its difficulty. KPC was on a run that was pretty much dead and decided to say YOLO and try the fling since he knew about it, and ended up getting it first try. This led to him pulling the run back to be a world record, making the fling just become part of the route. Gotta love glitches and moments like that in speedruns/speedrunning."

In this speedrun explained, we break down an Any% speedrun of Subnautica (with glitches and on Survival mode) done by the world record holder, Eclypsed. This run includes glitches and skips, including a movement speed glitch with the Seaglide, an item duplication glitch, and storage exploits. This video serves as explanation of the strategies used by Eclypsed to beat Subnautica in under 30 minutes.

#Subnautica #Speedrun

Drooping Stingers normally deal a bunch of damage over a short amount of time if we bump into them, but don’t deal damage if we touch them while Super Seaglide is active. Similarly, there’s a fauna called Crashfish who typically burst out of their hiding places to crash into you and explode, but don’t do that if we have Super Seaglide.

In short, the stingers ignore us because when Super Seaglide is active, the detectCollision variable in the stingers’ code is disabled, meaning collision with the player is never detected so damage is never dealt.

The Crashfish ignore us because when Super Seaglide is active, the player’s rigidbody velocity is set at 0, and Crashfish are triggered by any rigidbody velocity greater than 0, so since ours is stuck at 0, they don’t trigger (Note: the player’s rigidbody is what allows the player to experience physics)"

Yes, you read the title correctly. This is a speedrun to get pregnant in Fallout 4. This speedrun is made possible by using a ton of mods that allow for such actions to be possible in the game. In this speedrun, we utilize several glitches, including one exploit that lets us teleport across the map, and also have things like routing in XP to level up at a specific time. We do this very fast, very quick, very speedy.

Just in time for the release of Elden Ring, we’ve covered Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, and now finally the original Demon’s Souls (not the remake, sorry). With the game that started the Soulsborne series finally coming to the tomatoanus channel for a SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we get to go over the From Software game that started it all. This Any% run is performed by the world record holder, InSilico_ (Silico for short). This run is packed with skips, tech, the occasional out-of-bounds, and making boss fights look simple, plus a few extra goodies (cat face is my favorite).

In this video, we cover the Any% speedrun of Bloodborne, with the stipulations that the run is done on the current patch and that no clipping is performed by use of enemy grabs. This run is performed by Pinkman, who sets a blistering pace through Yharnam utilizing skips, farming Blood Echoes and Insight, and just absolutely demolishing bosses. Included in this run (which is completed in under 30 minutes) is a glitch that allows you to duplicate items.

This run is done by one of the top runners for the category, Kaadzik, who demonstrates his ability and knowledge of the mechanics of the game, beating it in around ten minutes. This run was chosen to be covered by my Patrons, who hold the world record in my heart for coolest people around.

We waited two years to cover Dishonored 2 after covering the first Dishonored, but we waited only three months to cover Dark Souls II after covering the first Dark Souls. In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we return to the world From Software created and break down an Any% speedrun of Dark Souls II, by world record holder Stennis. This run is on patch 1.02 and features a couple game-breaking glitches and exploits that allow Stennis to beat the game in under 15 minutes. Included in this run is a glitch that allows you to duplicate items, leading to the potential for infinite souls without farming.

Yes, you read the title correctly. This is a speedrun to eat a baby in Fallout 3. This speedrun is made possible by using a mod called Acquired Immunity that adds an option when interacting with Baby Marie in The Pitt DLC. In this speedrun we utilize several glitches, including one level glitch that skips levels, and is barely used in Fallout speedruns.

The speedrun of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has always been a fascinating one. Recently an exploit called Arbitrary Code Execution was made possible for humans to do in an actual run, officially lowering the world record by over seven minutes. While fast, this speedrun is incredibly complicated, making for a great speedrun to cover in Speedrun Explained.

This run was absolutely wild to say the least. While it may not have certainly gone the most smoothly in terms of gameplay, it definitely made for a lot of hilarious and interesting scenarios that I'm glad we all got to share together. I'm incredibly grateful for GDQ giving me the opportunity to do the Fallout Anthology run at their event, and can't thank them enough for the opportunity.

About when we got to Fallout 3 in the run, the donation tracker at the event went offline and stayed down for the rest of the run. Staff was trying their hardest to get it back up and working, but they weren’t able to do so until after my run. That’s why there’s a lack of donations through most the run. You can see me looking to the donation table at several points throughout the run to see if they were back up because I was running out of things to say, but every time Edobean would just shake her head at me saying that it wasn’t fixed yet, so a lot of moments throughout the run was just us trying to think of things to talk about.

Speedrun to get laid in Fallout 4 (SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED - World Record)...

In this speedrun of Fallout 4, we race across the wasteland to have a horizontal dance partner shortly after our spouse is taken out. I covered this run in an Anthology video about 11 months ago, but a bit has changed in the run since then. In this video, we take a deep dive into those changes with professionally drawn visual aids.

Prey 2017 has a relatively short Any% speedrun, while remaining an incredibly deep and rewarding run. For this video, I teamed up with seeker (the current Prey 2017 Any% world record holder) a third time to finish out the speedrun explained trilogy, and to do our best to explain this intense run.

1:15 - Hi, it looks like you understand how the asterisk thing works.

2:09 - This run is performed on version 1.0, which is a downpatched version of the game.

2:24 - Also, when we speedrun this game, we load a speedrun save to perform the run. This save file is setup so that two Psi Hypos will spawn in a locker near the start of the run, avoiding having to reset non-stop just to get the items to spawn. For the sake of the video though, the main menu and intro of the game are included before cutting to the first segment of the run, where seeker loaded the pre-made save.

2:34 - When we’re on top of the shelves, we’re technically in a crouched state, but we can still sprint, allowing for us to leap across the gap to the door with the chair on it.

4:42 - Doing this stairs slide is super useful since we run out of stamina just as we get to it, and allows us to continue moving fast without sprinting.

5:16 - Clipping with the GLOO Cannon is actually settings dependent; you have to run the game with your ‘Object Detail’ setting on at least ‘Medium’ (no other settings in the game matter). The reason for this, is that the hitbox of objects is dependent on what the object detail setting is set to. If the setting isn’t on medium or higher, then the hitbox of the glob won’t extend into the wall.

8:52 - Once out-of-bounds, we drop down onto a ledge and slide to avoid bumping into a rock that’s hard to see, but is still there and has collision.

10:08 - If for some reason we don’t get three of each, we can perform a glitch where we recycle whatever material of which we don’t have three, but split the stack in half in the recycling section. This will give us more material out than we put in. This is why we play on version 1.0, because Arkane made sure their mass balance equations were working in the next patch.

The Any% speedrun for Dishonored is fast paced and full of several movement glitches. For this video, I teamed up with seeker (the current Dishonored Any% world record holder) a second time to do our best to explain this entertaining speedrun.

6:27 - This elevator only works on the 1.2 patch (or earlier), since we also clip through the ceiling by holding ‘Shift’ and a directional key.

6:45 - The jump at this moment onto the pipe has its climbing animation skipped thanks to precise positioning and scroll-jumping, as mentioned in the commentary.

7:15 - Alternatively, you can perform the Sewer Leap at 30 FPS if you don’t have a free-scrolling mouse wheel. Playing at 30 FPS makes the jump easier since you have to send fewer inputs at a lower FPS.

7:20 - At one point, we drop down onto a big rock, and are sure to land more towards the middle of the rock. If we land near the edge of the rock, we’ll fall too far, causing for us to die from fall damage.

7:33 - Overall, all this out-of-bounds work saves approximately 26 seconds in the sewers area compared to staying in-bounds. I was careful with my wording when I said “26 seconds in the sewers area” because overall, it actually saves even more time.  By going out-of-bounds, we skip picking up both our sword and crossbow. In Dishonored, you run faster when you don’t have your sword out, which was utilized in old routes by performing a glitch called ‘Swordless.’ Swordless was performed by pressing right click during the sword flourish that Corvo performs whenever you put away your sword. Because we skip picking up the sword and crossbow, we never actually have the sword and never have to perform swordless.

10:31 - When we reach the end of the Void, we grab the rune, but rather than use it to level up an ability right away, we press escape and save using it until we exit, so that we can use the rune to level up Agility.

10:42 - After we exit the Void, you’ll hear the blink sound while the screen is still black. This is seeker spamming the blink button so that he doesn’t have to switch to blink after he gains control of Corvo.

12:30 - We also are able to blink over the Wall of Light with a precise blink; a little too far to the left or too low and you die from it.

12:58 - Also, when seeker threw the springrazor, he also crouched so he could pickpocket the guy before he died, allowing us to obtain the ‘Blackmail Journal.’

15:47 - When seeker interacts with the door to enter this area, he is sure not to spam F to interact. If he does so, it can create a “wrong warp” where later in the mission when we rescue Emily, interacting with the door we use to exit will actually return us to this first door, losing time.

16:03 - Upon entering, we immediately lift the master key off of Madame Prudence. We then will grab a nearby rune, level up blink to level two (increasing our blink distance), and enter into a big lobby area.

18:40 - Damage boosts in Dishonored are FPS dependant, so seeker waits for as long as possible in the loading screen before the boost to make sure his game doesn’t have any FPS issues.

24:45 - The water in this section isn’t actually everywhere in the out-of-bounds; if you go a bit lower than where seeker is, you’ll fall into the void and die.

DOOM 2016 is a fast paced and intense speedrun. For this video, I teamed up with seeker, current DOOM Any% world record holder to bring you a video breaking down the speedrun as it's happening.

3:10 - This is why we run the game with all the settings I just went over, and try to maintain a steady 200 FPS. Railboosting at FPSs lower than 200 just won’t cut it.

3:31 - seeker makes everything in the game look so simple to do, but really, it isn’t. That being said, I implore you to learn the speedrun of this game, because it is actually really fun to learn and to practice. I myself haven’t actually completed a full run yet, but I’ve been learning it on and off for about two months now and enjoy every second of practice with this game. It’s just a game that lends itself really well to speedruns.

3:55 - He also hugs the left wall to avoid getting hit by a Possessed, which saves time since the enemy won’t have to recover from the animation before turning back towards seeker afterwards.

4:26 - seeker discharges 12 times in a row, which is to time out how far he’s running since he has no visual frame of reference while out-of-bounds in this level.

4:46 - You may also be asking how we have both jump and mod bound to the scroll wheel, and the answer to that is pretty simple. DOOM 2016 allows the player to bind actions to both ‘Scroll Wheel Up’ and ‘Scroll Wheel Down,’ so we bind jump to one and mod to the other.

5:36 - Like most PC speedruns, DOOM’s leaderboard is organized by in-game time, taking into account how long each individual’s loading screens are. Loading screens aren’t counted into your final time due to hardware differences between PCs, so it’s worth it to access another loading screen if it skips having to wait for something in real time.

15:49 - I should reiterate that when he’s damaging Possessed to setup GK clips, the body parts that seeker shoots are very intentional. The Possessed have to be in a specific animation with a specific GK performed in order to perform each individual clip.

This is a brand new category for Fallout 4 speedrunning that has been joked around about for awhile, but is just now having runs completed. This speedrun ended up being a world record, despite me not liking this category at all. And don't worry, as the speedrun is explained in the video, I don't make any pirate puns.

There's a newly discovered glitch in Fallout: New Vegas that saves approximately 90 seconds in the Any% speedrun. In this video, we go over what the new glitch is, explain how it works, and how it was found. I recommend you watch an earlier run of New Vegas (link below) if you're unfamiliar with the speedrun in its entirety. This video is mostly dedicated to the new glitch and its repercussions on the run.

This speedrun consists of beating each of the main games in the Fallout Series, back-to-back. Or, more like back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back. This run only consists of Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas, and 4, for reasons explained early on in the video. This world record is pretty solid, but is improvable. Don't believe I'll work on improving it for awhile though.

Glitchless Speedrun of Fallout 4 (Heavy Commentary)...
Wanted to have a change of pace for how I presented this new world record, seeing as doing heavy commentary in my usual format for this run would be almost two hours long. The run itself was pretty decent, not perfect and definitely improvable. Not too sure I want to grind this category though, will probably only improve upon this run if new strats are found or my run is contested.

This is a speedrun to cause Mama Murphy to overdose in Fallout 4. This category is a fun idea, but not the most riveting run in execution. The one part that makes it a unique category is the restocking glitch that is performed to respawn chems in the cooler. The actual run in the video wasn’t awful, but could probably be brought down to about 15:35 if you get lucky and play well.

This is a speedrun to sleep with all 12 sleeping partners in Fallout New Vegas. Speedrunning this category is a nice change of pace from typical New Vegas speedruns, due to the increased number of glitches used, and how unique the route is. This run was solid, but far from perfect. However, I'm content with the run despite knowing it can be lowered by around a minute.

This is a speedrun to have sex in each of the main games in the Fallout series (Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas, and 4). Speedrunning this category is fun because of how quickly you switch games, but at the same time exhausting because of how quickly you switch games. This run is pretty good overall and I'm content with it. Some mistakes here and there, but the overall quality is pretty good. Could probably be pushed down another 30 seconds if I grinded it extensively.

This was officially my 666th total attempt for New Vegas Any%, no joke. Decided around Thanksgiving to decide to grind this run to under 13 minutes, and took about five streams of grinding. New Vegas is a really fun run, and I enjoy doing it, but it's incredibly exhausting compared to some other runs. Probably won't do runs of this category for awhile, which is ok.

As I noted in the beginning of the vid, I was sick when recording the commentary for this run, so I apologize if my voice sounds hoarse or I sound congested.

The speedrun of Fallout 3 is one of my favorites, but I've never posted a personal best of mine with heavy commentary thoroughly explaining the run. It's a pretty straightforward and easy to follow run once you know the basics, but the problem is the basics are a bit esoteric. My intentions with this video are to show via heavy commentary that Fallout 3 is a pretty fast paced and fun run, especially from the point where you enter Little Lamplight until the end.

Really good run, took hundreds upon hundreds of attempts to get a run with all the hard loadwarps first try and a pace like this one, with this being only the second of all the runs I did that had a good Kellogg slide. First ever sub 40 run and I'm very proud of it, it definitely was not easy. Really don't like the state this run puts any% in though because of how annoying the loadwarps are, but worth it for the 39. Even without the new strats I incorporated, it's the best speedrun of Fallout 4 to date. Maybe the most proud I've been of a world record, or run in general of mine.
