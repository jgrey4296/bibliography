Yes, you read the title correctly. In a bout of madness, I asked @MeatyJesus to mod Immolation, the absolute worst spell in the series, into Dark Souls 1. And he did not disappoint.

Get your popcorn ready. It's time to find out if we can beat the game by setting ourselves on fire over and over again.
Can you beat Dark Souls 1 with only the Immolation spell?

The Hidden Blade is the signature weapon of the Assassin's Creed series. Without AC, there would be no hidden blade. Without the hidden blade, there would be no AC.

And considering how deadly it is in the right circumstances, one has to ask : can it be deadly in EVERY circumstance? Even ones that it wasn't designed for?

Shadow of Mordor is a great game, and has lots of stealth, combat, and ""magic"" options. So what if we took away 2/3 of that? After all, it's kinda silly that a ghost can use physical weapons.

Diablo 2 is a silly game - there are so many abilities, spells, and modifiers that it's really hard to keep track of it all. So what if we made it into an idle game, where all you have to do is walk to the end?

Well, with the Thorns modifier and Paladin skill, you (probably) can!

If you put firebombs in your game, I WILL find you. And I will burn your world to the ground.

GRIME is very quickly becoming my favorite metroidvania. If you haven't tried it out, I would highly recommend it - the (free) new DLCs have breathed even more life into this game.

GRIME has several consumables. But I have no idea what they do, how they work, or if they're even any good. Several of them are firebomb-type weapons though.
You know what we have to do.

Can you beat Grime with only consumables, and without parrying? Time to find out.

Big thanks to @demajen  for their beautiful maps. Couldn't have found all the bosses/secrets I needed to make this run a reality without them.

(Open the description if you're looking for the code to make your own XCOM runs)

XCOM has been good to me, but it's time to move on to bigger and better things. Namely XCOM2.
But we can't let it go quietly - so for the sake of all the good times we've had, how about one last round?

Can you beat XCOM Enemy Within with only Psionic Powers?

For those who are looking to improve their own XCOM experience, here's the code for you to copy:

[XComGame.XComTacticalInput]
.Bindings=(Name=""F1"", Command=""GivePsiGift"", Alt=True)

[Engine.PlayerInput]

.Bindings=(Name=""F8"", Command=""slomo 1.5"", Alt=True)
.Bindings=(Name=""F9"", Command=""slomo 2.0"", Alt=True)

The first two codes are for making your own Psionic Only run, and the 2nd two codes are for giving yourself a fast-forward button.
If you want to tinker with adding MORE codes to XCOM, here's a list of all the possible codes you can input, and what they do: https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Console_Commands_-_XCOM:EU_2012

Greatbows are rarely used outside of PvP montages in Dark Souls, and for good reason. They're impossibly slow and unwieldy.  But they ARE strong.

The question is, are they strong enough to beat Dark Souls 1 with 100 greatarrows or less?

Dark Souls 2 has some weird spells. But why does it have three poisonous mist spells? What are you trying to tell me, DS2? Is this your version of offering me a stick of gum?

Personal attacks aside, I've never actually used these spells, despite them popping up in every Dark Souls game. So I guess it's time we figured out : Can you beat Dark Souls 2 with just bad breath?

Daggers are quick. Daggers are fun. Daggers are not very good when it comes to DPS. But if you have the proper build, know what to look for when it comes to status effects, and are willing to parry the world, who knows? They might just be some of the best weapons you can use.

Can you beat Dark Souls 1 with only daggers? Probably. But HOW easily can you beat Dark Souls 1 with only daggers is the true question.

That's right. In a burst of stupidity, my brain decided that EVERY boss in Dark Souls 2 SOFTFS needed to be burned to the ground with Immolation. And after countless hours of slowly walking around enemies and banging my head against my desk in frustration, I can only come to a single conclusion:

...I don't want to play anymore.

I beat Dark Souls 2, every single boss, with only the Immolation pyromancy, so that you don't have to. Let this video be a stopgap against all the players who were curious and wanted to try it for themselves. Please, for the love of all that is holy, YOU DON'T HAVE TO, STOP, WHAT ARE YOU-

Ahh, Far Cry 3. An open-world jungle hellscape. A pirate-island simulator. Skyrim, but with guns.

I've only ever finished this game once, and I don't remember all that much from it, but I do remember one thing: Far Cry 3 has a flamethrower. And probably other methods of making flames as well.
