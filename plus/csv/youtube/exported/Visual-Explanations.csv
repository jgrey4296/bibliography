I'm still working on the sequel to the bézier video! turns out the scope has grown quite large - it's going to be a very long video, but I'm hoping it will be done soon!

These functions are super fundamental to trigonometry, as well as incredibly useful! Here's an example of how you can construct a 2D vector pointing at a given angle using trigonometry. Note that in this case it will always have a length of 1, also known as unit length, which means that by definition it's a normalized vector!

Clipped from the super long shaders for beginners stream of two days ago!

Note that this is for two normalized vectors, it's a bit different if only one or none of them are normalized. Regardless - the case of two normalized vectors is very common in shaders!

For example, Lambert shading is the dot product of the light direction and the surface normal

Full video will be up soon!
