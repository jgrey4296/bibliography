"IqVoEpRIaKg","The Impact of Akira: The Film that Changed Everything","Super Eyepatch Wolf","2020-04-23","2018-05-05","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IqVoEpRIaKg/hqdefault.jpg","CORRECTION:
 The music in Akira is not “Traditional Japanese music” it is a mix of world music but primarily Gamelan from Indonesia, Indonesia having had some… colonization issues with Japan, so that’s a pretty bad mistake to make. I Apologize for the mistake, and to anyone who was offended.


Hey. Akira’s a pretty good movie. Kind of changed the history of anime. Gonna talk about it now.

I’ve come to regret how I depicted Berserks director Shin Itagaki in this video. I don’t know what happened during the production of this series, and blaming it on the contributions of a single person is an irresponsible and damaging statement to make. I apologize to Itagaki, and for the potential misinformation spread. I will do my best to do better in the future.
