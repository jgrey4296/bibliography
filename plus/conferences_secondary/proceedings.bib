CMNA 1 was held at ICCS in San Francisco in 2001, CMNA 2 was held at ECAI in Lyon in 2002, CMNA 3 was held at IJCAI in Acapulco in 2003, CMNA 4 was held at ECAI in Valencia in 2004, CMNA 5 was held at IJCAI in Edinburgh in 2005, and CMNA 6 was held at ECAI in Riva del Garda in 2006. Like the past editions, CMNA 7 intends to recognise and consolidate the critical mass that research in the field overlapping Argumentation Theory and Artificial Intelligence has developed in recent years, with contributions from diverse fields such as argumentation theory, pragmatics, multi-agent communication, corpus analysis, computer science and artificial intelligence. We would like to thank all of the authors at this year's meeting for their varied and stimulating contributions, and our Programme Committee for their continuing support and commitment. We look forward to an exciting workshop in},
