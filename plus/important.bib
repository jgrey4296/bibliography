Using a teaching/learning perspective rather than a research-oriented approach, an understanding of the meta-languages is accessible to anyone with a basic grounding in discrete mathematics and programming language concepts. Throughout the book, valuable hands-on laboratory exercises provide the opportunity for practical application of difficult concepts. Various exercises and examples, implementing syntactic and semantic specifications on real systems, give students hands-on practice. Supplemental software is available on disk or via file transfer protocol. This book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate level course on the formal syntax and semantics of programming languages.},

A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions. Understanding Institutional Diversity explains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed. The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.},

JavaCOP enforces user-defined typing constraints written in a declarative and expressive rule language. We have validated our design by (re)implementing a range of type systems and program checkers. By using a program constraint system to implement pluggable types, programmers are able to check that their programs will operate correctly in restricted environments, adhere to strict programming rules, avoid null pointer errors or scoped memory exceptions, and meet style guidelines, while programming language researchers can easily experiment with novel type systems.},

 abstract     = {Abstract This article introduces a new theory of intention representation which is based on a structure called a Dynamic Intention Structure (DIS). The theory of DISs was motivated by the problem of how to properly represent incompletely specified intentions and their evolution. Since the plans and intentions of collaborating agents are most often elaborated incrementally and jointly, elaboration processes naturally involve agreements among agents on the identity of appropriate agents, objects and properties that figure into their joint plans. The paper builds on ideas from dynamic logic to present a solution to the representation and evolution of agent intentions involving reference to incompletely specified and, possibly, mutually dependent intentions, as well as the objects referenced within those intentions. It provides a first order semantics for the resulting logic. A companion paper extends further the logical form of DISs and explores the problem of logical consequence and intention revision.},

The articles forming this volume reflect a variety of important trends, developments, and applications covering a range of current topics relating to the theory and applications of argumentation. Our aims in this introduction are, firstly, to place these contributions in the context of the historical foundations of argumentation in AI and, subsequently, to discuss a number of themes that have emerged in recent years resulting in a significant broadening of the areas in which argumentation based methods are used. We begin by presenting a brief overview of the issues of interest within the classical study of argumentation: in particular, its relationship-in terms of both similarities and important differences-to traditional concepts of logical reasoning and mathematical proof. We continue by outlining how a number of foundational contributions provided the basis for the formulation of argumentation models and their promotion in AI related settings and then consider a number of new themes that have emerged in recent years, many of which provide the principal topics of the research presented in this volume. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract     = {In this paper we give a formal definition of the requirements translation language Behavior Trees. This language has been used with success in industry to systematically translate large, complex, and often erroneous requirements documents into a structured model of the system. It contains a mixture of state-based manipulations, synchronisation, message passing, and parallel, conditional, and iterative control structures. The formal semantics of a Behavior Tree is given via a translation to a version of Hoare's process algebra CSP, extended with state-based constructs such as guards and updates, and a message passing facility similar to that used in publish/subscribe protocols. We first provide the extension of CSP and its operational semantics, which preserves the meaning of the original CSP operators, and then the Behavior Tree notation and its translation into the extended version of CSP. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract     = {How are tasks bundled into and across jobs within organizations? In this paper, I develop a model of this process of job design by drawing on a multisite qualitative study of task allocation following the installation of a DNA sequencer. The model that emerges is one of the assembly of tasks through multiple subassembly processes with multiple assemblers. Four activities produced requirements and requests for job designs and propositions about how to meet these: actively searching, passively receiving, doing work, and invoking preexisting ideas. The ideas that emerge from these processes are further transformed through reconciliation, interpretation, and performance. My observations show that this overall process is far reaching and incorporates many elements, not all of which are explicitly intended for job designs. The arrangements that emerge from this process are not the product of a deliberate and controlled job design process within the boundaries of a single organization},

Just like agents, organizations should also be able to adapt themselves to changing environments. In order to develop a theory of how this reorganization should be performed we need a formal framework in which organizations, organizational performance and the reorganization itself can be described. In this article, we present a formal description of reorganization actions in Logic forAgent Organization. We show how this formalization can support the preservation of some nice properties of organizations while it can also be used to reason about which reorganization is needed to achieve some basic organizational properties.

The sequences of alternatives is modelled by a non-classical (substructural) operator. In this paper we provide a modal logic based axiomatisation of the intuition they propose, and we discuss some variants (in particular for the notion of social intention, intentions that are compliant with norms). Given that the outcome operator is substructural, we first propose a novel sequence semantics (a generalisation of possible world semantics) to model the outcome operator, and we prove that the axiomatisation is sound and complete with respect to the new semantics.},

 abstract     = {This dissertation is motivated by the need, in today's globalist world, for a precise way to enable governments, organisations and other regulatory bodies to evaluate the constraints they place on themselves and others. An organisation's modus operandi is enacting and fulfilling contracts between itself and its participants. Yet, organisational contracts should respect external laws, such as those setting out data privacy rights and liberties. Contracts can only be enacted by following contract law processes, which often require bilateral agreement and consideration. Governments need to legislate whilst understanding today's context of national and international governance hierarchy where law makers shun isolationism and seek to influence one another. Governments should avoid punishment by respecting constraints from international treaties and human rights charters. Governments can only enact legislation by following their own, pre-existing, law making procedures. In other words, institutions, such as laws and contracts are designed and enacted under constraints.},
