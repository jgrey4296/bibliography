The latter aspect is used to emphasize that some of the inferences necessary to understand a particular story may be guided by "structural" properties of the story which rule out certain expectations. Finally, a possible synthesis of these two aspects is suggested.},

We report an experience with a seven-year-old autistic child whose active and enjoyable explorations in controlling the LOGO turtle formed the basis for the development of language for communication, both verbal and nonverbal. The strikingly rapid effect produced involved two features seldom shown by the child, VIZ. the onset of spontaneous language based on descriptions of the turtle's behaviour, and the active seeking out of social interaction. We argue that this follows from the self-validating effect of understanding and being understood, i.e. sharing a sense of relevance, and that this in turn follows from the highly structured but creatively open-ended nature of the LOGO environment, In which the crucial step of "seeing what is relevant" is made transparently easy.},

By representing in the computer detailed patterns of disease evolving with the passage of time, we are able to deal with multiple followup visits. Sequences of suggested therapies for the various types and stages of progressions of glaucoma have also been incorporated in the model.},

 abstract     = {There are two types of reasoning about actions - Planning and Interpretation. We are involved in the Interpretation of observed sequences of actions using a psychological theory of act interpretation. The Interpreter uses a model space to maintain a current description of the observational world. There are two kinds of problems in maintaining a model - Consistency with respect to what we know about the domain and Correctness with respect to an external observable world. Past discussions of the problem have dealt mainly with the Issue of consistency. The issue of ensuring correctness is a difficult one and this paper proposes the Heuristic of using the detected inconsistencies of the model state as a guide to selectively removing disparities between the model state and the observable world. A Knowledge Representation Framework is described which allows all aspects of the Frame Problem to be tackled coherently. An example is given to illustrate our approach and an indication of the rule learning capability of the system Is given. The Focus problem for the Observer is introduced and Is shown to be complementary to the Frame Problem for the modelling system.},
