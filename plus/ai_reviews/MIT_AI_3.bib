 abstract     = {A number of models developed in work often called ''neural-net'' research may be of interest to physiologists working on the problem of memory. From this work comes a variety of ideas on how networks of neuron-like elements can be made to act as learning machines. Some of these may suggest ways in which memory may be stored in nervous systems. It is important, perhaps, to recognize that these models were not founded at all on physiological ideas; they really stem from psychological and introspective notions. They all involve some form of alteration of synaptic transmission properties contingent on the pre- and post-synaptic activity during and after the relevant behavior. This notion is suggested not so much by actual observation of synapses as by the introspective simile of wearing down a path {\textendash} the ''ingraining'' of a frequently-traveled route. Below we shall argue that this idea is useful and suggestive, but not sufficient. These models can be made to account for learning connections between stimuli and responses on a low level, but do not seem to account for higher, symbolic behavior. We will argue that the latter suggests a return to the search for localization of memory, a topic that has been unpopular for many years.},

The coach`s function is to intervene occasionally in student generated situations to discuss appropriate skills that might improve the student`s play. Coaching is a natural context in which to investigate the teaching and learning processes, but it is a demanding task. The computer must be able to analyze the student`s performance in terms of a model of the underlying problem solving skills. This model must represent not only expertise for the task but also intermediate stages of problem solving skill and typical difficulties encountered by the learner. Implementing several generations of computer coaches to meet these demands has resulted in a model that represents problem solving skills a san evolving set of rules for a domain acting on an evolving representation of the problem and executed by a resource-limited problem solver.

Recently, a unified approach to the specification of surface reflectance in terms of both incident and reflected beam geometry has been proposed. The reflectance-distribution function (BRDF).

A particular causal argument does not rule out other possibly conflicting causal arguments for the same circuit. If the actual behavior of the circuit is know or determined by measurements, the correct argument can be identified. The selected argument is a rationalization for the observed behavior since it explains but does not guarantee the observed behavior. A causal analysis program QUAL has been implemented which determines the response of a circuit to changes in input signals. It operates with a simple four valued arithmetic of unknown, unchanging, increasing and decreasing.

Such transformations may be characterized (and caricaturized) by the following instructions for a transformation: ''Take that substring there, and that other one starting with ''Black'', which has the substring mentioned third as the first; then inserts the second substring mentioned; omit the first and leave the unmentioned parts of the original string unchanged.''},

It is argued that not only does this theory provide explicit boundary conditions at certain points in the image, but that the imaging process also provides implicit conditions on all other points in the image. This argument is used to derive conditions on possible algorithms for computing the surface. Additional constraining principles are applied to the problem; specifically that the process be performable by a local-support parallel network. Some mathematical tools, differential geometry, Coons surface patches and iterative methods of convergence, relevant to the problem of constructing the surface are outlined. Specific methods for actually computing the surface are examined.},

 abstract     = {We present a design for a class of computers whose 'instruction sets' are based on LISP. LISP, like traditional stored-program machine languages and unlike most high-level languages, conceptually stores programs and data in the same way and explicitly allows programs to be manipulated as data. LISP is therefore a suitable language around which to design a stored-program computer architecture. LISP differs from traditional machine languages in that the program/data storage is conceptually an unordered set of linked record structures of various sizes, rather than an ordered, indexable vector of integers or bit fields of fixed size. The record structures can be organized into trees or graphs. An instruction set can be designed for programs expressed as such trees. A processor can interpret these trees in a recursive fashion, and provide automatic storage management for the record structures. We describe here the basic ideas behind the architecture, and for concreteness give a specific instruction set (on which variations are certainly possible). We also discuss the similarities and differences between these ideas and those of traditional architectures. A prototype VLSI microprocessor has been designed and fabricated for testing. It is a small-scale version of the ideas presented here, containing a sufficiently complete instruction interpreter to execute small programs, and a rudimentary storage allocator. We intend to design and fabricate a full-scale VLSI version of this architecture in 1979.},

 abstract     = {In the following sections we show, by a simple direct construction, that computations done by Turing machines can be duplicated by a very simple symbol manipulation process. The process is described by a simple form of Post Canonical system with some very strong restrictions. First, the system is monogenic; each formula (string of symbols) of the system can be affected by one and only one production (rule of inference) to yield a unique result. Accordingly, if we begin with a single axiom (initial string) the system generates a simply ordered sequence of formulas, and this operation of a monogenic system brings to mind the idea of a machine. The Post canonical system is further restricted to be of the ''Tag'' variety, described briefly below. It was shown in [1] that Tag systems are equivalent to Turing machines. The proof in [1] is very complicated and uses lemmas concerned with a variety of two-tape non-writing Turing machines. Our proof here avoids these otherwise interesting machines and strengthens the main result, obtaining the theorem with a best possible ''deletion number'' P {\textendash} 2. Also, the representation of the Turing machine in the present system has a lower degree of exponentiation, which may be of significance in applications. These systems seem to be of value in establishing unsolvability of combinatorial problems.},

Surface contours by and large are not as restricted as occluding contours and therefore pose a more difficult interpretation problem. Nonetheless, we are adept at perceiving a definite 3-D surface from even simple line drawings (e.g. graphical depictions of continuous functions of two variables). The solution of a specific surface shape comes by assuming that the physical curves are particularly restricted in their geometric relationship to the underlying surface. These geometric restrictions are examined.},

(b) The structure of the grammar rules cannot parse sentences which violate either of two constraints which Chomsky claims are linguistic universals. This result depends in part upon the computational use of Chomsky`s notion of Annotated Surface Structure. (c) The grammar interpreter provides a simple explanation for the difficulty caused by ''garden path'' sentences, such as ''The cotton clothing is made of grows in Mississippi''. To the extent that these properties, all of which reflect deep properties of natural language, follow from the original hypothesis, they provide indirect evidence for the truth of this assumption.

 abstract     = {A time-sharing system for the 7090 computer is being developed at the M.I.T. Computation Center whereby many users can communicate simultaneously with the computer through individual consoles. In the time-sharing system a time-sharing supervisor (TSS) program directs the running of each user`s program in such a manner that each user`s program is run in short bursts of computation. The effect is that the user sitting at his console has complete control over his program with unrestricted use of a large computing machine. Through the use of commands in the time-sharing system a user who writes a program in the FAP language can assemble his program, load it into core, and start the program. In order to make the most use of the time-sharing facility the user during the debugging stages of his program will want to dynamically monitor his running program and make changes as necessary. The proposed FAP language debugging program gives the user the facility to communicate with his program using the symbols defined within his program.},

The paradigm followed is one of teaching and testing, where the teaching is accomplished by presenting a sequence of positive and negative examples of the target concept. The core of the theory has been implemented and tested as computer programs. The theory addresses the problem of deciding when it is appropriate to merge descriptions and when it is appropriate to form a disjunctive split. The approach outlined has the advantage that it allows recovery from over generalizations. It is observed that negative examples play an important role in the decision making process, as well as in detecting over generalizations and instigating recovery. Because of the ability to recover from over generalizations when they occur, the system is less sensitive to the ordering of the training sequence than other systems. The theory is presented in a domain and representation independent format. A few conditions are presented, which abstract the assumptions made about any representation scheme that is to be employed within the theory. The work is illustrated in several different domains, illustrating the generality and flexibility of the theory.},

How can we manage memory which only once in a while violates stack restrictions, without paying a price the rest of the time? This paper provides an extremely simple way of doing so, in which only the part of the system which actually uses the stack needs to know anything about the stack. We call them Phantom Stacks because they are liable to vanish if subjected to close scrutiny.

We develop a language embedded in LSIP for describing layout artwork so we can procedurally define generators for generalized macro components. The generators accept parameters to produce the specialized instances used in a particular design.

 abstract     = {During the last half of the nineteenth century the need for formal methods of proof became evident to mathematicians who were making such confidence-shaking discoveries as non-Euclidean geometry. The demand is not to be denied; every jump must be barred from our deductions. That it is hard to satisfy must be set down to the tediousness of proceeding step by step. Every proof which is even a little complicated threatens to become inordinately long. [M1] G. Frege, 1884 This general desire for rigor has persisted since that time, and a great deal has been learned about formal methods. But, for the reason noted by Frege, very little of real mathematics has been done with full formal treatment. Our present hope is to use computers to take the drudgery out of formal demonstrations, just as they are taking it out of accounting. Toward this end, several programs are under way. They vary in purpose; the Proofchecker [H8, H9] is to be capable of filling the gaps of a proof; the work of Mott et. al. [H10] aims to achieve the equivalent of a desk calculator ability as an aid to a mathematician doing formal proofs. The most intriguing prospect, however, is that computers can eventually be made to both devise and prove interesting non-trivial theorems wholly on their own. The first of these desires, the devising of interesting conjectures, has not even been attempted. I believe, however, that we are on the verge of achieving the second of these ends, the mechanical proof of non-trivial theorems, a belief which I hope I can justify in the sequel.},

A number of problem solving schemes are developed making use of viewpoints and activities. It will be demonstrated that many kinds of heuristic search that are commonly implemented using backtracking can be reformulated to use parallel processing with advantage in control over the problem solving behavior. The semantics of Ether are such that such things as deadlock and race conditions that plague many languages for parallel processing cannot occur.

 abstract     = {Recently, Marr and Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is presented and consists of five steps: (1) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by $ abla^2G$, the laplacian of a gaussian function. (2) Zero-crossing in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (3) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero-crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, Marr and Poggio showed that false targets pose only a simple problem. (4) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2 dimensional sketch. To support the sufficiency of the Marr- Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. As well, statistical assumptions made by Marr and Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail.},

This locus of possible surface orientations can be reduced to a unique orientation at each point on the image sphere using 3 vantage points and taking the intersection of the loci of possible orientations derived from each vantage. It is also possible to derive a unique surface orientation at each image point through the use of an iterative constraint propagation technique along with the orientation information available at occluding boundaries. Both method are demonstrated for real images.},

 abstract     = {In previous heap storage systems, the cost of creating objects and garbage collection is independent of the lifetime of the object. Since objects with short lifetimes account for a large portion of storage use, it`s worth optimizing a garbage collector to reclaim storage for these objects more quickly. The garbage collector should spend proportionately less effort reclaiming objects with longer lifetimes. We present a garbage collection algorithm which: Makes storage for short-lived objects cheaper than storage for long-lived objects. Operates in real time {\textendash} object creation and access times are bounded. Increases locality of reference, for better virtual memory performance. Works well with multiple processors and a large address space.},

A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image.},

How then can we make it possible for a system to continue to function in the face of a very large number of plausibly useful chunks of knowledge? In response to this question we propose a framework for viewing issues of knowledge indexing and retrieval, a framework that includes what appears to be a useful perspective on the concept of a strategy. We view strategies as a means of controlling invocation in situations where traditional selection mechanisms become ineffective. We examine ways to effect such control, and describe meta-rules, a means of specifying strategies which offers a number of advantages. We consider at some length how and when it is useful to reason about control, and explore the advantages meta-rules offer for doing this.},

The algorithm is quite efficient; the marking pass visits words at most twice and usually once, and the loading pass is linear. 5.)

The basic problem is, how to segment a stream of movement into pieces each of which can be described separately. The representation proposed here is based upon segmenting a movement at moments when a component axis, e.g. an arm, starts to move relative to its local coordinate frame (here, the torso). So that for example walking is divided into a sequence of the stationary states between each swing of the arms and legs, and the actual motions between the stationary points (relative to the torso, not the ground).

 abstract     = {This paper outlines a three-step plan for generating English text from any semantic representation by applying a set of syntactic transformations to a collection of kernel sentences. The paper focuses on describing a program which realizes the third step of this plan. Step One separates the given representation into groups and generates from each group a set of kernel sentences. Step Two must decide based upon both syntactic and thematic considerations, the set of transformations that should be performed upon each set of kernels. The output of the first two steps provides the ''TASK'' for Step Three. Each element of the TASK corresponds to the generation of one English sentence, and in turn may be defined as a triple consisting of: (a) a list of kernel phrase markers; (b) a list of transformations to be performed upon the list of kernels; (c) a ''syntactic separator'' to separate or connect generated sentences. Step Three takes as input the results of Step One and Step Two. The program which implements Step three ''reads'' the TASK, executes the transformations indicated there, combines the altered kernels of each set into a sentence, performs a pronomialization process, and finally produces the appropriate English word string. This approach subdivides a hard problem into three more manageable and relatively independent pieces. It uses linguistically motivated theories at Step Two and Step Three. As implemented so far, Step Three is small and highly efficient. The system is flexible; all the transformations can be applied in any order. The system is general; it can be adapted easily to many domains.},

Since expert analysis must deal with very large, yet incomplete, data bases of unreliable facts about a complex world, the project would stringently test the applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques. After a significant effort however, I am forced to the conclusion that an intelligent, real-world system of the kind envisioned is currently out of reach. Some of the difficulties were due to the size and complexity of the domain. As its true scale became evident, the available resources progressively appeared less adequate. The representation and reasoning problems that arose were persistently difficult and fundamental work is needed before the tools will be sufficient to engineer truly intelligent assistants. Despite these difficulties, perhaps even because of them, much can be learned from the project. To assist future applications projects, I explain in this report some of the reasons for the negative result, and also describe some positive ideas that were gained along the way. In doing so, I hope to convey the respect I have developed for the complexity of real- world domains, and the difficulty of describing the ways experts deal them.},

 tags         = {__untagged},
 abstract     = {The term biological motion has been coined by G. Johansson (1973) to refer to the ambulatory patterns of terrestrial bipeds and quadripeds. In this paper a computational theory of the visual perception of biological motion is proposed. The specific problem addressed is how the three dimensional structure and motions of animal limbs may be computed from the two dimensional motions of their projected images. It is noted that the limbs of animals typically do not move arbitrarily during ambulation. Rather, for anatomical reasons, they typically move in single planes for extended periods of time. This simple anatomical constraint is exploited as the basis for utilizing a ''planarity assumption'' in the interpretation of biological motion. The analysis proposed is: (1) divide the image into groups of two or three elements each; (2) test each group for pairwise-rigid planar motion; (3) combine the results from (2). Fundamental to the analysis are two structure from planar motion` propositions. The first states that the structure and motion of two points rigidly linked and rotating in a plane is recoverable from three orthographic projections. The second states that the structure and motion of three points forming two hinged rods constrained to move in a plane is recoverable from two orthographic projections. The psychological relevance of the analysis and possible interactions with top down recognition processes are discussed.},

That is, that the properties of transactions and replies as they were defined did not correspond with our intuitions, and thus the definitions should be changed. The issues of what should constitute a transaction are discussed, and a new definition is presented which eliminates the discrepancies caused by the original definitions. Some properties of the newly defined transactions are discussed, and it is shown that the results of Hewitt and Baker`s paper still hold given the new definitions.},

 abstract     = {Recently there has been considerable interest in efficient formulations of manipulator dynamics, mostly due to the desirability of real-time control or analysis of physical devices using modest computers. The inefficiency of the classical Lagrangian formulation is well known, and this has led researchers to seek alternative methods. Several authors have developed a highly efficient formulation of manipulator dynamics based on the Newton-Euler equations, and there may be some confusion as to the source of this efficiency. This paper shows that there is in fact no fundamental difference in computational efficiency between Lagrangian and Newton-Euler formulations. The efficiency of the above-mentioned Newton-Euler formulation is due to two factors: the recursive structure of the computation and the representation chosen of the rotational dynamics. Both of these factors can be achieved in the Lagrangian formulation, resulting in an algorithm identical to the Newton-Euler formulation. Recursive Lagrangian dynamics has been discussed previously by Hollerbach. This paper takes the final step by comparing in detail the representations that have been used for rotational dynamics and showing that with a proper choice of representation the Lagrangian formulation is indeed equivalent to the Newton-Euler formulation.},

 institution  = {MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory},
 tags         = {__untagged},
 abstract     = {We describe the concept of distributed problem solving and define it as the cooperative solution of problems by a decentralized and loosely coupled collection of problem solvers. This approach to problem solving offers the promise of increased performance and provides a useful medium for exploring and developing new problem- solving techniques. We present a framework called the contract net that specifies communication and control in a distributed problem solver. Task distribution is viewed as an interactive process, a discussion carried on between a node with a task to be executed and a group of nodes that may be able to execute the task. We describe the kinds of information that must be passed between nodes during the discussion in order to obtain effective problem-solving behavior. This discussion is the origin of the negotiation metaphor: Task distribution is viewed as a form of contract negotiation. We emphasize that protocols for distributed problem solving should help determine the content of the information transmitted, rather than simply provide a means of sending bits from one node to another. The use of the contract net framework is demonstrated in the solution of a simulated problem in area surveillance, of the sort encountered in ship or air traffic control. We discuss the mode of operation of a distributed sensing system, a network of nodes extending throughout a relatively large geographic area, whose primary aim is the formation of a dynamic map of traffic in the area.

 abstract     = {The next generation of artificial intelligence programs will require the ability to organize knowledge as groups of active objects. Each object should have only its own local expertise, the ability to operate in parallel with other objects, and the ability to communicate with other objects. Artificial Intelligence programs will also require a great deal of flexibility, including the ability to support multiple representations of objects, and to incrementally and transparently replace objects with new, upward-compatible versions. To realize this, we propose a model of computation based on the notion of an actor, an active object that communicates by message passing. Actors blur the conventional distinction between data and procedures. The actor philosophy is illustrated by a description of our prototype actor interpreter Act 1.},

We present the actor model of computation as being appropriate for parallel systems, since it organizes knowledge as active objects acting independently, and communicating by message passing. We describe the parallel constructs in our experimental actor interpreter Act 1. Futures create concurrency, by dynamically allocating processing resources much as Lisp dynamically allocates passive storage. Serializers restrict concurrency by constraining the order in which events take place, and have changeable local state. Using the actor model allows parallelism and synchronization to be implemented transparently, so that parallel or synchronized resources can be used as easily as their serial counterparts.},

 abstract     = {Marr has emphasized the difficulty in understanding a biological system or its components without some idea of its goals. In this paper, a preliminary goal for color vision is proposed and analyzed. That goal is to determine where changes of material occur in a scene (using only spectral information). This goal is challenging for two reasons. First, the effects of many processes (shadowing, shading from surface orientation changes, highlights, variations in pigment density) are confounded with the effects of material changes in the available image intensities. Second, material changes are essentially arbitrary. We are consequently led to a strategy of rejecting the presence of such confounding processes. We show there is a unique condition, the spectral crosspoint, that allows rejection of the hypothesis that measured image intensities arise from one of the confounding processes. (If plots are made of image intensity versus wavelength from two image regions, and the plots intersect, we say that there is a spectral crosspoint.) We restrict our attention to image intensities measured from regions on opposite sides of an edge because material changes almost always cause edges. Also, by restricting our attention to luminance discontinuities, we can avoid peculiar conspiracies of confounding processes that might mimic a material change. Our crosspoint conjecture is that biological visual systems interpret spectral crosspoints across edges as material changes. A circularly symmetric operator is designed to detect crosspoints: it turns out to resemble the double-opponent cell which is commonplace in biological color vision systems.},

This sort of learning pervades Management, Political science, Economics, Law, and Medicine as well as the development of common-sense knowledge about life in general. This paper presents a theory of how it is possible to learn by precedents and exercises and describes an implemented system that exploits the theory. The theory holds that causal relations identify the regularities that can be exploited from past experience, given a satisfactory representation for situations. The representation used stresses actors and objects which are taken from English-like input and arranged into a kind of semantic network. Principles emerge in the form of production rules which are expressed in the same way situations are.},

Three key ideas in current artificial intelligence theories of engineering problem solving are: Abstraction {\textendash} using a simplified view of the problem to guide the problem solving process. Inspection {\textendash} problem solving by recognizing the form (''plan'') of a solution. Debugging {\textendash} incremental modification of an almost satisfactory solution to a more satisfactory one. These three techniques are typically used together in a paradigm which we call AID (for Abstraction, Inspection, Debugging): First an abstract model of the problem is constructed in which some important details are not intentionally omitted. In this simplified view inspection methods are more likely to succeed, yielding the initial form of a solution. Further details of the problem are then added one at a time with corresponding incremental modifications to the solution. This paper states the goals and milestones of the remaining three years of a five year research project to study the fundamental principles underlying the design and construction of large software systems and to demonstrate the feasibility of a computer aided design tool for this purpose, called the programmer`s apprentice.},

This prediction, however, is difficult to test because observers normally interpret the cues as occlusion evidence and normally see the subjective contours. This article describes a patient with visual agnosia who is both unable to make the usual occlusion interpretations and is unable to see subjective contours. He has, however, normal ability to interpret standard visual illusions, stereograms, and in particular, stereogram versions of the standard subjective contour figures, which elicit to him strong subjective edges in depth (corresponding to the subjective contours viewed in the monocular versions of the figures).},

As a logic, Omega achieves the goal of an intuitively sound and consistent theory of classes which permits unrestricted abstraction within a powerful logic system. Description abstraction is the construct provided in Omega corresponding to set abstraction. Attributions and inheritance are the basic mechanisms for knowledge structuring. To achieve flexibility and incrementality, the language allows descriptions with an arbitrary number of attributions, rather than predicates with a fixed number of arguments as in predicate logic. This requires a peculiar interpretation for instance descriptions, which in turn provides insights into the use and meaning of several kinds of attributions. The formal treatment consists in presenting semantic models for Omega, deriving an axiomatization and establishing the consistency and completeness of the logic.},

 abstract     = {The electrical properties of the different anatomical types of retinal ganglion cells in the cat were calculated on the basis of passive cable theory from measurements made on histological material provided by Boycott and Wassle (1974). The interactions between excitation and inhibition when the inhibitory battery is near the resting potential can be strongly nonlinear in these cells. We analyse some of the integrative properties of an arbitrary passive dendritic tree and we then derive the functional properties which are characteristic for the various types of ganglion cells. In particular, we derive several general results concerning the spatial specificity of shunting inhibition in ''vetoing'' an excitatory input (the ''on path'' property) and its dependence on the geometrical and electric properties of the dendritic tree. Our main conclusion is that specific branching patterns coupled with a suitable distribution of synapses are able to support complex information processing operations on the incoming signals. Thus, a neuron seems likely to resemble an (analog) ISI circuit with thousands of elementary processing units {\textendash} the synapses {\textendash} rather than a single logical gate. A dendritic tree would be near to the ultimate in microelectronics with little patches of postsynaptic membrane representing the fundamental units for several elementary computations.},

Surface interpolation is considered to be the process of computing the most conservative solution consistent with boundary conditions. The ''most conservative'' solution is modeled using the calculus of variations to find the minimum function that satisfies a given performance index. To guarantee the existence of a minimum function, Grimson has recently suggested that the performance index should be a semi-norm. It is shown that all quadratic forms in the second partial derivatives of the surface satisfy this criterion. The seminorms that are, in addition, rotationally symmetric form a vector space whose basis is the square Laplacian and the quadratic variation. Whereas both seminorms give rise to the same Euler condition in the interior, the quadratic variation offers the tighter constraint at the boundary and is to be preferred for surface interpolation.},

The optical flow in the image plane is the input, while the instantaneous rotation and translation of the body are the output. If optical flow could be determined precisely, it would only have to be known at a few places to compute the parameters of the motion. In practice, however, the measured optical flow will be somewhat inaccurate. It is therefore advantageous to consider methods which use as much of the available information as possible. We employ a least-squares approach which minimizes some measure of the discrepancy between the measured flow and that predicted from the computed motion parameters. Several different error norms are investigated. In general, our algorithm leads to a system of nonlinear equations from which the motion parameters may be computed numerically. However, in the special cases where the motion of the camera is purely translational or purely rotational, use of the appropriate norm leads to a system of equations from which these parameters can be determined in closed form.},

Yet, the visual perception is clearly of complete surfaces, and this perception is consistent for different observers. Since mathematically the class of surfaces which could pass through the known boundary points provided by the stereo system is infinite and contains widely varying surfaces, the visual system must incorporate some additional constraints besides the known points in order to compute the complete surface. Using the image irradiance equation, we derive the surface consistency constraint, informally referred to as no news is good news. The constraint implies that the surface must agree with the information from stereo or motion correspondence, and not vary radically between these points. An explicit form of this surface consistency constraint is derived, by relating the probability of a zero- crossing in a region of the image to the variation in the local surface orientation of the surface, provided that the surface albedo and the illumination are roughly constant. The surface consistency constraint can be used to derive an algorithm for reconstructing the surface that ''best'' fits the surface information provided by stereo or motion correspondence.},

To understand common sense physical reasoning and make machines that interact significantly with the physical world we must understand the qualitative reasoning about processes, their effects, and their limits. Qualitative Process theory defines a simple notion of physical process that appears quite useful as a language in which to write physical theories. Reasoning about processes also motivates a new qualitative representation for quantity, the Quantity Space. This paper includes the basic definitions of Qualitative Process theory, describes several different kinds of reasoning that can be performed with them, and discusses its implications for causal reasoning. The use of the theory is illustrated by several examples, including figuring out that a boiler can blow up, that an oscillator with friction will eventually stop, and how to say that you can pull with a string, but not push with it.},

 abstract     = {Computational modules early in the human vision system typically generate sparse information about the shapes of visible surfaces in the scene. Moreover, visual processes such as stereopsis can provide such information at a number of levels spanning a range of resolutions. In this paper, we extend this multi-level structure to encompass the subsequent task of reconstructing full surface descriptions from the sparse information. The mathematical development proceeds in three steps. First, the surface most consistent with the sparse constraints is characterized as the solution to an equilibrium state of a thin flexible plate. Second, local, finite element representations of surfaces are introduced and, by applying the finite element method, the continuous variational principle is transformed into a discrete problem in the form of a large system of linear algebraic equations whose solution is computable by local-support, cooperative mechanisms. Third, to exploit the information available at each level of resolution, a hierarchy of discrete problems is formulated and a highly efficient multi-level algorithm, involving both intra-level relaxation processes and bi-directional inter-level algorithm, involving both intra-level relaxation processes and bidirectional inter-level local interpolation processes is applied to their simultaneous solution.. Examples of the generation of hierarchies of surface representations from stereo constraints are given. Finally, the basic surface approximation problem is revisited in a broader mathematical context whose implications are of relevance to vision.},

 abstract     = {Free space is represented as a union of (possibly overlapping) generalized cones. An algorithm is presented which efficiently finds good collision free paths for convex polygonal bodies through space littered with obstacle polygons. The paths are good in the sense that the distance of closest approach to an obstacle over the path is usually far from minimal over the class of topologically equivalent collision free paths. The algorithm is based on characterizing the volume swept by a body as it is translated and rotated as a generalized cone and determining under what conditions generalized cone is a subset of another.},

 abstract     = {We will briefly outline a computational theory of the first stages of human vision according to which (a) the retinal image is filtered by a set of centre-surround receptive fields (of about 5 different spatial sizes) which are approximately bandpass in spatial frequency and (b) zero-crossings are detected independently in the output of each of these channels. Zero-crossings in each channel are then a set of discrete symbols which may be used for later processing such as contour extraction and stereopsis. A formulation of Logan`s zero-crossing results is proved for the case of Fourier polynomials and an extension of Logan`s theorem to 2- dimentsional functions is also approved. Within this framework, we shall describe an experimental and theoretical approach (developed by one of us with M. Fahle) to the problem of visual acuity and hyperacuity of human vision. The positional accuracy achieved, for instance, in reading a vernier is astonishingly high, corresponding to a fraction of the spacing between adjacent photoreceptors in the fovea. Stroboscopic presentation of a moving object can be interpolated by our visual system into the perception of continuous motion; and this ''spatio-temporal'' interpolation also can be very accurate. It is suggested that the known spatiotemporal properties of the channels envisaged by the theory of visual processing outlined above implement an interpolation scheme which can explain human vernier acuity for moving targets.},

 tags         = {__untagged},
 abstract     = {Human vision is adept at inferring the shape of a surface from the image of curves lying across the surface. The strongest impression of 3-D shape derives from parallel (but not necessarily equally spaced) contours. In [Stevens 1981a] the computational problem of inferring 3-D shape from image configurations is examined, and a theory is given for how the visual system constrains the problem by certain assumptions. The assumptions are three: that neither the viewpoint not the placement of the physical curves on the surface is misleading, and that the physical curves are lines of curvature across the surface. These assumptions imply that parallel image contours correspond to parallel curves lying across an approximately cylindrical surface. Moreover, lines of curvature on a cylinder are geodesic and planar. These properties provide strong constraint on the local surface orientation. We describe a computational method embodying these geometric constraints that is able to determine the surface orientation even in places where locally it is very weakly constrained, by extrapolating from places where it is strongly constrained. This computation has been implemented, and predicts local surface orientation that closely matches the apparent orientation. Experiments with the implementation support the theory that our visual interpretation of surface shape from contour assumes the image contours correspond to lines of curvature.},

 tags         = {__untagged},
 abstract     = {This paper is about an implemented natural language interface that translates from English into semantic net relations and from semantic net relations back into English. The parser and companion generator were implemented for two reasons: (a) to enable experimental work in support of a theory of learning by analogy; (b) to demonstrate the viability of a theory of parsing and generation built on commutative transformations. The learning theory was shaped to a great degree by experiments that would have been extraordinarily tedious to perform without the English interface with which the experimental data base was prepared, revise, and revised again. Inasmuch as current work on the learning theory is moving toward a tenfold increase in data-base size, the English interface is moving from a facilitating role to an enabling one. The parsing and generation theory has two particularly important features: (a) the same grammar is used for both parsing and generation; (b) the transformations of the grammar are commutative. The language generation procedure converts a semantic network fragment into kernel frames, chooses the set of transformations that should be performed upon each frame, executes the specified transformations, combines the altered kernels into a sentence, performs a pronominalization process, and finally produces the appropriate English word string. Parsing is essentially the reverse of generation. The first step in the parsing process is splitting a given sentence into a set of kernel clauses along with a description of how those clauses hierarchically related to each other. The clauses are hierarchically related to each other. The clauses are used to produce a matrix embedded kernel frames, which in turn supply arguments to relation- creating functions. The evaluation of the relation-creating functions results in the construction of the semantic net fragments.},

These extensions are as follows: If-then rules are augmented by unless conditions, creating augmented if-then rules. An augmented if- then rule is blocked whenever facts in hand directly demonstrate the truth of an unless condition, the rule is called a censor. Like ordinary augmented if-then rules, censors can be learned. Definition rules are introduced that facilitate graceful refinement. The definition rules are also augmented if-then rules. They work by virtue of unless entries that capture certain nuances of meaning different from those expressible by necessary conditions. Like ordinary augmented if-then rules, definition rules can be learned. The strength of the ideas is illustrated by way of representative experiments.

The expressional form of the notation makes it possible to construct and modify such loops rapidly and accurately. The implementation of the notation does not actually use sequences but rather compiles loop expressions into iterative loop code.

A particular approach to reasoning about change and contradiction is discussed. This approach uses Omega`s viewpoint mechanism. Omega`s viewpoint mechanism is a general contradiction handling facility. Unlike other Knowledge Representation systems, when a contradiction is reached the reasons for the contradiction can be analyzed by the deduction mechanism without having to resort to a backtracking mechanism. The Viewpoint mechanism is the heart of the Problem Solving Support Paradigm. This paradigm supplements the classical AI view of problem solving. Office workers are supported using the Problem Solving Support Paradigm. An example is presented where Omega`s facilities are used to support an office worker`s problem solving activities. The example illustrates the use of viewpoints and of Omega`s capabilities to reason about it`s own reasoning process.},

This paper gives the mathematical underpinnings for building programs (plan checkers) to carry out approach (2) automatically. The plan checker uses a geometric CAD-type database to infer the effects of actions and the propagation of errors. It does this symbolically rather than numerically, so that computations can be reversed and desired resultant tolerances can be used to infer required initial tolerances or the necessity for sensing. The checker modifies plans to include sensing and adds constraints to the plan which ensure that it will succeed. An implemented system is described and results of its execution are presented. The plan checker could be used as part of an automatic planning system of as an aid to a human robot programmer.},

In this paper, we present a computational study of the measurement of motion. Similar to other visual processes, the motion of elements is not determined uniquely by information in the changing image; additional constraint is required to compute a unique velocity field. Given this global ambiguity of motion, local measurements from the changing image, such as those provided by directionally- selective simple cells in primate visual cortex, cannot possibly specify a unique local velocity vector, and in fact, specify only one component of velocity. Computation of the full two- dimensional velocity field requires the integration of local motion measurements, either over an area, or along contours in the image. We will examine possible algorithms for computing motion, based on a range of additional constraints. Finally, we will present implications for the biological computation of motion.},

The two are related because, under local analysis, limitations on the interpretation of orthographic velocity fields also apply to perspective projection. The following results are established: When the interpretation is applied locally, the 3-D interpretation of the perspective velocity field is unstable. The orthographic velocity field determines the structure of the inducing object exactly up to a depth-scaling. For planar objects, the orthographic velocity field always admits two distinct solutions up to depth-scaling. The 3-D structure is determined uniquely by a ''view and a half'' of the orthographic velocity field.},

The Downey, Sethi and Tarjan algorithm for computing congruence closures can be used to convert finite set of equations E to a context free expression grammar G such that for any expression u the equivalence class of u under E is precisely the language generated by an expression form I`(u) under grammar G. the fact that context free expression languages are closed under intersection is used to derive an algorithm for computing a grammar for the equivalence class of a given expression under any finite disjunction of finite sets of equations between ground expressions. This algorithm can also be used to derive a grammar representing the equivalence class of conditional expressions of the form if P then u else v. The description of an equivalence class by a context free expression grammar can also be used to simplify expressions under ''well behaved'' simplicity orders. Specifically if G is a context free expression grammar which generates an equivalence class of expressions then for any well behaved simplicity order there is a subset G` of the productions G such that the expressions generated by G` are exactly those expressions of the equivalence class which are simplicity bounds and whose subterms are also simplicity bounds. Furthermore G` can be computed from G in order nlog(n) time plus the time required to do order nlog(n) comparisons between expressions where n is the size G.},

Points provide a basis for general notions of isomorphism and symmetry. The general notions of isomorphism and symmetry in turn provide a basis for natural, simple, and universal definitions of abstractness, essential properties and functions, canonicality, and representations.

Thus, spines are usually associated with an important feature of neurons {\textendash} their high degree of connectivity {\textendash} one of the most obvious differences between present computers and brains. We have analysed the electrical properties of a cortical (spiny) pyramidal cell on the basis of passive cable theory, from measurements made on histological material, using the solution of the cable equation for an arbitrary branched dendritic tree. As postulated by Rall, we found that the somatic potential induced by firing synapse on a spine is a very sensitive function of the dimension of the spine.

The basis of this analysis is the solution o the cable equation for an arbitrary branched dendritic tree. We determined the potential at the soma as a function of the synaptic input (transient conductance changes) and as a function of the spine neck dimensions. From our investigation four major points emerge: 1. Spine may effectively compress the effect of each single excitatory synapse on the soma, mapping a wide range of inputs onto a limited range of outputs (nonlinear saturation). This is also true for very fast transient inputs, in sharp contrast with the case of a synapse on a dendrite. 2. The somatic depolarization due to an excitatory synapse on a spine is a very sensitive function of the spine neck length and diameter. Thus the spine can effectively control the resulting saturation curve. This might be the basic mechanism underlying ultra-short memory, long-term potentiation in the hippocampus or learning in the cerebellum. 3. Spines with shunting inhibitory synapses on them are ineffective in reducing the somatic depolarization due to excitatory inputs on the dendritic shaft or on other spines. Thus isolated inhibitory synapses on a spine are not expected to occur. 4. The conjunction of an excitatory synapse with a shunting inhibitory synapse on the same spine may result in a time-discrimination circuit with a temporal resolution of around 100usec.},

A fundamental requirement at this level is the capacity to establish visually abstract shape properties and spatial relations.

For the human visual system, the perception of spatial properties and relations that are complex from a computational standpoint, nevertheless often appears immediate and effortless. This apparent immediateness and ease of perceiving spatial relations is, however, deceiving. It conceals in fact a complex array of processes highly specialized for the task. The proficiency of the human system in analyzing spatial information far surpasses the capacities of current artificial systems. The study of the computations that underlie this competence may therefore lead to the development of new more efficient processors for the spatial analysis of visual information. It is suggested that the perception of spatial relations is achieved by the application to the base representations of visual routines that are composed of sequences of elemental operations. Routines for different properties and relations share elemental operations. Using a fixed set of basic operations, the visual system can assemble different routines to extract an unbounded variety of shape properties and spatial relations. At a more detailed level, a number of plausible basic operations are suggested, based primarily on their potential usefulness, and supported in part by empirical evidence. The operations discussed include shifting of the processing focus, indexing to an odd-man-out location, bounded activation, boundary tracing, and marking. The problem of assembling such elemental operations into meaningful visual routines is discussed briefly.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents some mathematical results concerning the measurement of motion of contours. A fundamental problem of motion measurement in general is that the velocity field is not determined uniquely from the changing intensity patterns. Recently Hildreth     Ullman have studied a solution to this problem based on an Extremum Principle [Hildreth (1983), Ullman     Hildreth (1983)]. That is, they formulate the measurement of motion as the computation of the smoothest velocity field consistent with the changing contour. We analyse this Extremum principle and prove that it is closely related to a matching scheme for motion measurement which matches points on the moving contour that have similar tangent vectors. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the principle to yield the correct velocity field. These results have possible implications for the design of computer vision systems, and for the study of human vision.},

Visual analysis of an image consists of two stages. The first stage segments the image into regions and determines the target region. The photometric stereo system provides the surface normal distribution of the scene. The system segments the scene into isolated regions using the surface normal distribution rather than the brightness distribution. The second stage determines object attitude and position by comparing the surface normal distribution with the extended-Gaussian- image.

The proof assumes that the filtered signal can be represented as a polynomial of finite, albeit possibly very high, order. An argument suggests that this restriction is not essential. Stability of the reconstruction scheme is briefly discussed. The result applies to zero- and level-crossings of linear differential operators of gaussian filters. The theorem is extended to two dimensions, that is to images. These results are reminiscent of Logan`s theorem.

A description of this movement is not provided to our visual system directly, however; it must be inferred from the pattern of changing intensity that reaches the eye. This paper examines the problem of motion measurement, which we formulate as the computation of an instantaneous two- dimensional velocity field from the changing image. Initial measurements of motion take place at the location of significant intensity changes, as suggested by Marr and Ullman (1981). These measurements provide only one component of local velocity, and must be integrated to compute the two-dimensional velocity field. A fundamental problem for this integration stage is that the velocity field is not determined uniquely from information available in the changing image. We formulate an additional constraint of smoothness of the velocity field, based on the physical assumption that surfaces are generally smooth, which allows the computation of a unique velocity field. A theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this computation yields the correct velocity field suggests that the solution is physically plausible. Empirical studies show the predictions of this computation to be consistent with human motion perception.},

We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simulation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hypotheses consistent with these constraints is small.

As background we review our basic approach to describing structure and behavior, then explore some of the technologies used previously in troubleshooting. Difficulties encountered there lead us to a number of new contributions, four of which make up the central focus of this paper. We describe a technique we call constraint suspension that provides a powerful tool for troubleshooting. We point out the importance of making explicit the assumptions underlying reasoning and describe a technique that helps enumerate assumptions methodically. The result is an overall strategy for troubleshooting based on the progressive relaxation of underlying assumptions. The system can focus its efforts initially, yet will methodically expand its focus to include a broad range of faults. Finally, abstracting from our examples, we find that the concept of adjacency proves to be useful in understanding why some faults are especially difficult and why multiple different representations are useful.},

In this paper, we study with psychophysical techniques the tolerance to vertical disparity in situations in which false targets abound {\textendash} as in random dot stereograms {\textendash} and eye movements are eliminated. Our results show that small amounts of vertical disparity significantly impair depth discrimination in a forced-choice task. Our main results are: a) vertical disparity of only the central ''figure'' part of a random dot stereogram can be tolerated up to about 3.5`, b) vertical disparity of the ''figure + ground'' is tolerated up to about 6.5`, and c) the performance of the Grimson implementation of the Marr-Poggio stereo matching algorithm for the stereograms of experiment (a) is consistent with the psychophysical results. The algorithm`s tolerance to vertical disparity is due exclusively to the spatial averaging of the underlying filters. The algorithm cannot account by itself for the results of experiment (b). Eye movements, which are the principal registration mechanism for human stereopsis, are accurate to within about 7`. Our data suggest that tolerance to this residual vertical disparity is attained by two non-motor mechanisms: 1) the spatial average performed by the receptive fields that filter the two images prior to stereo matching, and 2) a non-motor shift mechanism that may be driven at least in part by monocular cues.},

Here we show how results in machine vision provide techniques for automatically directing a mechanical manipulator to pick one object at a time out of a pile. The attitude of the object to be picked up is determined using a histogram of the orientations of visible surface patches. Surface orientation, in turn, is determined using photometric stereo applied to multiple images. These images are taken with the same camera but differing lighting. The resulting needle map, giving the orientations of surface patches, is used to create an orientation histogram which is a discrete approximation to the extended Gaussian image. This can be matched against a synthetic orientation histogram obtained from prototypical models of the objects to be manipulated. Such models may be obtained from computer aided design (CAD) databases. The method thus requires that the shape of the objects be described, but it is not restricted to particular types of objects.},

This is an open invitation to come in and discuss applications. We are particularly interested in (i) projects leading to a working page-reader system, first for teletype character sets and later to include recognition of larger alphabets and hand-written corrections, and (ii) projects leading to recognition functions that will be useful in coordination with the mechanical hand system.},

 abstract     = {Development of highly intelligent computers requires a conceptual foundation that will overcome the limitations of the von Neumann architecture. Architectures for such a foundation should meet the following design goals: * Address the fundamental organizational issues of large-scale parallelism and sharing in a fully integrated way. This means attention to organizational principles, as well as hardware and software. * Serve as an experimental apparatus for testing large-scale artificial intelligence systems. * Explore the feasibility of an architecture based on abstractions, which serve as natural computational primitives for parallel processing. Such abstractions should be logically independent of their software and hardware host implementations. In this paper we lay out some of the fundamental design issues in parallel architectures for Artificial Intelligence, delineate limitations of previous parallel architectures, and outline a new approach that we are pursuing.},

 abstract     = {Many problems in early vision can be formulated in terms of minimizing an energy or cost function. Examples are shape-from- shading, edge detection, motion analysis, structure from motion and surface interpolation (Poggio, Torre and Koch, 1985). It has been shown that all quadratic variational problems, an important subset of early vision tasks, can be ''solved'' by linear, analog electrical or chemical networks (Poggio and Koch, 1985). IN a variety of situateions the cost function is non-quadratic, however, for instance in the presence of discontinuities. The use of non-quadratic cost functions raises the question of designing efficient algorithms for computing the optimal solution. Recently, Hopfield and Tank (1985) have shown that networks of nonlinear analog ''neurons'' can be effective in computing the solution of optimization problems. In this paper, we show how these networks can be generalized to solve the non-convex energy functionals of early vision. We illustrate this approach by implementing a specific network solving the problem of reconstructing a smooth surface while preserving its discontinuities from sparsely sampled data (Geman and Geman, 1984; Marroquin 1984; Terzopoulos 1984). These results suggest a novel computational strategy for solving such problems for both biological and artificial vision systems.},

We show that given a sufficient number of surface patches with the same illumination it is possible to solve these equations up to an overall scaling factor.

The question ''What differentiates the good ones from the bad ones?'' is discussed, and then the problem of how to implement a computational model of the human ability to come up with such analogies (and to have a sense for their quality) is considered. A key part of the proposed system, now under development is its dependence on statistically emergent properties of stochastically interacting ''codelets'' (small pieces of ready- to-run code created by the system, and selected at random to run with probability proportional to heuristically assigned ''urgencies''). Another key element is a network of linked concepts of varying levels of ''semanticity'', in which activation spreads and indirectly controls the urgencies of new codelets. There is pressure in the system toward maximizing the degree of ''semanticity'' or ''intensionality'' of descriptions of structures, but many such pressures, often conflicting, must interact with one another, and compromises must be made. The shifting of (1) perceived oundaries inside structures, (2) descriptive concepts chosen to apply to structures, and (3) features perceived as ''salient'' or not, is called ''slippage''. What can slip, and how are emergent consequences of the interaction of (1) the temporary (''cytoplasmic'') structures involved in the analogy with (2) the permanent (''Platonic'') concepts and links in the conceptual proximity network, or ''slippability network''. The architecture of this system is postulated as a general architecture suitable for dealing not only with fluid analogies, but also with other types of abstract perception and categorization tasks, such as musical perception, scientific theorizing, Bongard problems and others.},

Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and object oriented reasoning. Object-oriented reasoning includes reasoning about space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance.

This movement may be represented by a two- dimensional velocity field that assigns a direction and magnitude of velocity to elements in the image. This paper presents a method for computing the velocity field, with three main components. First, initial measurements of motion in the image take place at the location of significant changes, which give rise to zero-crossings in the output of the convolution of the image with a *** operator. The initial motion measurements provide the component of velocity in the direction perpendicular to the local orientation of the zero-crossing contours. Second, these initial measurements are integrated along contours to compute the two-dimensional velocity field. Third, an additional constraint of smoothness of the velocity field, based on the physical constraint that surfaces are generally smooth, allows the computation of a unique velocity field. The details of an algorithm are presented, with results of the algorithm applied to artificial and natural image sequences.},

Since then a number psychophysical experiments have suggested possible refinements to the model and modifications to the algorithm. As well, recent computational experiments applying the algorithm to a variety of natural images, especially aerial photographs, have led to a number of modifications.

We derive a set of constraints for sparse sensory data that are applicable to a wide variety of sensors and examine their characteristics. We then use known bounds on the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems together with explicit estimates of the effectiveness of the constraints derived for the case of sparse, noisy three-dimensional sensory data to obtain general theoretical bounds on the number of interpretations expected to be consistent with the data. We show that these bounds are consistent with empirical results reported previously. The results are used to demonstrate the graceful degradation of the recognition technique with the presence of noise in the data, and to predict the number of data points needed in general to uniquely determine the object being sensed.},

We call this material change circumstance the 'opposite slope sign condition.' With this criterion as a foundation, we construct a representation of spectral information that facilitates the recognition of material changes. Our theory has implications for both psychology and neurophysiology. In particular, Hering's notion of opponent colors and psychologically unique primaries, and Land's results in two-color projection can be interpreted as different aspects of the visual system's goal of categorizing materials. Also, the theory provides two basic interpretations of the function of double-opponent color cells described by neurophysiologists.},

Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation.

Specifically we propose the following: 1.) A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement, disparity ect. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. 2.) There exists a selective mapping from this early representation into a more central representation, such that at any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the selected location. 3.) We discuss some selection rules that determine which location will be mapped into the central representation. The major rule, using the saliency or conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is implemented using a so- called Winner-Take-All network. A hierarchical pyramid-like architecture is proposed for this network.

If the angle of force at the object finger contact can be determined, slip can be prevented by the proper adjustment of finger forces. Another important tactile sensing task is finding the edged and corners of an object, since they are usually feasible grasping locations. This paper describes how this information can be extracted from the finger- object contact using strain sensors beneath a compliant skin. For determining contact forces, strain measurements are easier to use than the surface deformation profile. The finger is modelled as an infinite linear elastic half plane to predict the measured strain for several contact types and forces. The number of sensors required is less than has been proposed for other tactile recognition tasks. A rough upper bound on sensor density requirements for a specific depth is presented that is bas3ed on the frequency response of the elastic medium. The effects of different sensor stiffness on sensor performance are discussed.},

 abstract     = {One of the best definitions of early vision is that it is inverse optics {\textemdash} a set of computational problems that both machines and biological organisms have to solve. While in classical optics the problem is to determine the images of physical objects, vision is confronted with the inverse problem of recovering three-dimensional shape from the light distribution in the image. Most processes of early vision such as stereomatching, computation of motion and the ''structure from'' processes can be regarded as solutions to inverse problems. This common characteristic of early vision can be formalized: most early vision problems are ''ill- posed problems'' in the sense of Hadamard. We will show that a mathematical theory developed for regularizing ill-posed problems leads in a natural way to the solution of the early vision problems in terms of variational principles of a certain class. This is a new theoretical framework for some of the variational solutions already obtained in the analysis of early vision processes. It also shows how several other problems in early vision can be approached and solved.},

 abstract     = {The development of increasingly sophisticated and powerful computers in the last few decades has frequently stimulated comparisons between them and the human brain. Such comparisons will become more earnest as computers are applied more and more to tasks formerly associated with essentially human activities and capabilities. The expectation of a coming generation of ''intelligent'' computers and robots with sensory, motor and even ''intellectual'' skills comparable in quality to (and quantitatively surpassing) our own is becoming more widespread and is, I believe, leading to a new and potentially productive analytical science of ''information processing''. In no field has this new approach been so precisely formulated and so thoroughly exemplified as in the field of vision. As the dominant sensory modality of man, vision is one of the major keys to our mastery of the environment, to our understanding and control of the objects which surround us. If we wish to created robots capable of performing complex manipulative tasks in a changing environment, we must surely endow them with (among other things) adequate visual powers. How can we set about designing such flexible and adaptive robots? In designing them, can we make use of our rapidly growing knowledge of the human brain, and if so, how at the same time, can our experiences in designing artificial vision systems help us to understand how the brain analyzes visual information?},

 abstract     = {The ordering constraint along epipolar lines is a powerful constraint that has been exploited by some recent stereomatching algorithms. We formulate a generalized ordering constraint, not restricted to epipolar lines. We prove several properties of the generalized ordering constraint and of the ''forbidden zone'', the set of matches that would violate the constraint. We consider both the orthographic and the perspective projection case, the latter for a simplified but standard stereo geometry. The disparity gradient limit found in the human stereo system may be related to a form of the ordering constraint. To illustrate our analysis we outline a simple algorithm that exploits the generalized ordering constraint for matching contours of wireframe objects. We also show that the use of the generalized ordering constraint implies several other stereo matching constraints: a0 the ordering constraint along epipolar lines, b) figural continuity, c) Binford`s cross-product constraint, d) Mayhew and Frisby`s figural continuity constraint. We finally discuss ways of extending the algorithm to arbitrary 3-D objects.},

 abstract     = {This proposal addresses some of the biophysical events possibly underlying fast activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficiency. Dendritic spines in the cortex have attracted increased attention over the last years as a possible locus of cellular plasticity given the large number of studies reporting a close correlation between presynaptic activity (or lack of thereof) and changes in spine shape. This is highlighted by recent reports, showing that the spine cytoplasm contains high levels of actin. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that a high level of intracellular free calcium Ca squared positive, is a prerequisite for various forms of synaptic potentiation. We propose a series of plausible steps, linking presynaptic electrical activity at dendritic spines with a short lasting change in spine geometry. Specifically, we conjecture that the spike-induced excitatory postsynaptic potential triggers an influx of Ca squared positive into the spine, where it will rapidly bind to intracellular calcium buffers such as calmodulin and calcineurin. However, for prolonged or intense presynaptic electrical activity, these buffers will saturate, the free Ca squared positive will then activate the actin/myosin network in the spine neck, reversibly shortening the length of the neck and increasing its diameter. This change in the geometry of the spine will lead to an increase in the synaptic efficiency of the synapse. We will discuss the implication of our proposal for the control of cellular plasticity and its relation to generalized attention and arousal.},

 abstract     = {A binocular-stereo-matching algorithm for making rapid visual range measurements in noisy images is described. This technique is developed for application to problems in robotics where noise tolerance, reliability, and speed are predominant issues. A high speed pipelined convolver for preprocessing images and an unstructured light technique for improving signal quality are introduced to help enhance performance to meet the demands of this task domain. These optimizations, however, are not sufficient. A closer examination of the problems encountered suggests that broader interpretations of both the objective of binocular stereo and of the zero-crossing theory of Marr and Poggio and required. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the problem of making a single primitive surface measurement. For example, to determine whether or not a specified volume of space is occupied, to measure the range to a surface at an indicated image location, or to determine the elevation gradient at that position. In this framework we make a subtle but important shift from the explicit use of zero-crossing contours (in band-pass filtered images) as the elements matched between left and right images, to use of the signs between zero-crossings. With this change, we obtain a simpler algorithm with a reduced sensitivity to noise and a more predictable behavior. The PRISM system incorporates this algorithm with the unstructured light technique and a high speed digital convolver. It has been used successfully by others as a sensor in a path planning system and a bin picking system.},

We show how receptionist can be used to regulate the se of shared resources by scheduling their access and providing protection against unauthorized or accidental access. A shared financial account is an example of the kind of resource that needs a receptionist. Issues involved in the implementation of scheduling policies for shared resources are also addressed. The modularity problems involved in implementing servers which multiplex the use of physical devices illustrated how delegation aids in the implementation of parallel problem solving systems for communities of actors.},

 abstract     = {A large gap exists at present between computational theories of vision and their possible implementation in neural hardware. The model of computation provided by the digital computer is clearly unsatisfactory for the neurobiologist, given the increasing evidence that neurons are complex devices, very different from simple digital switches. It is especially difficult to imagine how networks of neurons may solve the equations involved in vision algorithms in a way similar to digital computers. In this paper, we suggest an analog model of computation in electrical or chemical networks for a large class of vision problems, that map more easily into biological plausible mechanisms. Poggio and Torre (1984) have recently recognized that early vision problems such as motion analysis (Horn and Schunck, 1981; Hildreth, 1984a,b), edge detection (Torre and Poggio, 1984), surface interpolation (Grimson, 1981; Terzopoulos 1984), shape-from-shading (Ikeuchi and Horn, 1981) and stereomatching can be characterized as mathematically ill- posed problems in the sense of Hadamard (1923). Ill-posed problems can be ''solved'', according to regularization theories, by variational principles of a specific type. A natural way of implementing variational problems are electrical, chemical or neuronal networks. We present specific networks for solving several low-level vision problems, such as the computation of visual motion and edge detection.},
