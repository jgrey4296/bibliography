We do not pretend to have done this in this paper but we hope we have sown the first seeds towards a thorough first 5-year report of the software agents area. The paper contains some strong views not necessarily widely accepted by the agent community.},

This can aid enterprise agility, particularly where distributed information is a feature, as in the virtual enterprise. A model of the manufacturing Sales/Order process is proposed. The sales order is shown to be a naturally mobile element of the model. The subsequent decomposition of the agent types during detailed design and implementation reveals an abstract pattern for database query using agent technology. Finally, an overview of the security issues associated with mobile agents is discussed.},

This paper investigates whether Mobile Agents and Mobile Objects support improved system integration and agility in the manufacturing domain. We describe two systems built to support the Sales Order Process of a distributed manufacturing enterprise, using IBM's Aglets Software Development Kit. The Sales Order Process model and the requirements for agility used as the basis for these implementations are derived from data collected in an industrial case study. Both systems are evaluated using the Goal/Question/Metric methodology. Two new metrics for Semantic Alignment and Change Capability are presented and used to evaluate each system with respect to the degree of system agility supported. The work described provides evidence that both Mobile Agent and Mobile Object systems have inherent properties that can be used to build agile distributed systems. Further, Mobile Agents with their additional autonomy provide marginally greater support.},

But there is hardly any scenario in which this advantage has been proven or quantified on Internet scale. One important reason for this lack of quantification is that agent systems do not have global knowledge about the quality of network connections between arbitrary agent platforms and data servers. In this article, we present an approach for representing a network in a way that allows to derive approximately the quality of network connections between agent platforms and data servers. By using this representation we provide an algorithm which computes a schedule for the efficient dissemination of a mobile agent. The experimental validation of our approach shows that communication cost can be reduced by more than 50 percent in many situations.},

Specialized search tools have turned out to be much more effective and useful in certain domains. However, their ideas are often trimmed to one special domain so they cannot be applied to set up series of specialized tools. In addition, they tend to induce a tremendous load on the network. This contribution reports our approach for designing specialized search engines, so-called domain experts. These experts gather the documents relevant for their domain through mobile filter agents. We show the effectiveness of domain experts with a case study in the domain of scientific articles. Finally, we demonstrate that the filter agents' mobility can cause a significant reduction of the induced network load.},

The model is based on the notion of tuple centre, an enhanced tuple space whose behaviour can be extended according to the application needs. Every node of a TuCSoN environment provides its local communication space, made up of a multiplicity of independently-programmable tuple centres. This makes it possible to embed global system properties into the space of components' interaction, thus enabling flexible cooperation over space and time between agents, and permitting to easily face many issues critical to Internet applications, such as heterogeneity and dynamicity of the execution environments.},

 abstract     = {Adaptivity, both of the individual agents and of the interaction structure among the agents, seems indispensable for scaling up multi-agent systems (MAS's) in noisy environments. One important consideration in designing adaptive agents is choosing their action spaces to be as amenable as possible to machine learning techniques, especially to reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. One important way to have the interaction structure connecting agents itself be adaptive is to have the intentions and/or actions of the agents be in the input spaces of the other agents, much as in Stackelberg games. We consider both kinds of adaptivity in the design of a MAS to control network packet routing. We demonstrate on the OPNET event-driven network simulator the perhaps surprising fact that simply changing the action space of the agents to be better suited to RL can result in very large improvements in their potential performance: at their best settings, our learning-amenable router agents achieve throughputs up to five times better than that of the standard Bellman-Ford routing algorithm, even when the Bellman-Ford protocol traffic is maintained. We then demonstrate that much of that potential improvement can be realized by having the agents learn their settings when the agent interaction structure is itself adaptive.},

We present a summary of a mathematical theory for such automated configuration applicable when (as in the bar problem) the global goal can be expressed as minimizing a global energy function.

 abstract     = {This paper surveys the emerging science of how to design a {\textquotedblleft}COllective INtelligence{\textquotedblright} (COIN). A COIN is a large multi-agent system where: {\i}tem There is little to no centralized communication or control. {\i}tem There is a provided world utility function that rates the possible histories of the full system. In particular, we are interested in COINs in which each agent runs a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The conventional approach to designing large distributed systems to optimize a world utility does not use agents running RL algorithms. Rather, that approach begins with explicit modeling of the dynamics of the overall system, followed by detailed hand-tuning of the interactions between the components to ensure that they {\textquotedblleft}cooperate{\textquotedblright} as far as the world utility is concerned. This approach is labor-intensive, often results in highly nonrobust systems, and usually results in design techniques that have limited applicability. In contrast, we wish to solve the COIN design problem implicitly, via the {\textquotedblleft}adaptive{\textquotedblright} character of the RL algorithms of each of the agents. This approach introduces an entirely new, profound design problem: Assuming the RL algorithms are able to achieve high rewards, what reward functions for the individual agents will, when pursued by those agents, result in high world utility? In other words, what reward functions will best ensure that we do not have phenomena like the tragedy of the commons, Braess's paradox, or the liquidity trap? Although still very young, research specifically concentrating on the COIN design problem has already resulted in successes in artificial domains, in particular in packet-routing, the leader-follower problem, and in variants of Arthur's El Farol bar problem. It is expected that as it matures and draws upon other disciplines related to COINs, this research will greatly expand the range of tasks addressable by human engineers. Moreover, in addition to drawing on them, such a fully developed science of COIN design may provide much insight into other already established scientific fields, such as economics, game theory, and population biology.},

 abstract     = {This paper investigates distorting the reward function to improve the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm. This issue is particularly important when many random variables contribute to performance, and in particular in large, heterogeneous, multi-agent systems. For tractability, we concentrate on a very simple scenario in which the utility of a {\textquotedblleft}student{\textquotedblright} is an undiscounted sum of rewards, and each such reward is a sample of a distribution over a multi-dimensional Euclidean space, where the precise distribution sampled at time t is determined by the student's action at time t. First we derive the formula for the amount of improvement in performance possible by distorting the reward function. We show that as the number of actions the student can take is increased, using non-distorted reward functions results in the worst possible performance with probability 1. We then derive some general upper bounds on the amount of possible improvement in performance for the case where the student can only choose between two possible actions. Next we analyze a particular instance of this scenario in which the underlying distributions are Gaussian. We derive exact formulas for how much performance improvement is possible with a particular parameterized class of distortions of the reward function. We then derive a Bayesian algorithm for how a {\textquotedblleft}teacher{\textquotedblright} should estimate from a finite set of data which of the distortions from such a class to use. We end with computer experiments verifying the gain in performance entailed by use of that algorithm, and discuss the general implications of this work for large, heterogeneous, multi-agent systems.},

In particular we do not want the agents to {\textquotedblleft}work at cross-purposes{\textquotedblright} as far as the global goal is concerned. We use the term artificial COllective INtelligence (COIN) to refer to systems that embody solutions to this problem. In this paper we present a summary of a mathematical framework for COINs. We then investigate the real-world applicability of the core concepts of that framework via two computer experiments: we show that our COINs perform near optimally in a difficult variant of Arthur's bar problem (and in particular avoid the tragedy of the commons for that problem), and we also illustrate optimal performance for our COINs in the leader-follower problem.},

The methodology is general, in that it is applicable to a wide range of multi-agent systems, and comprehensive, in thatit deals with both the macro-level (societal) and the micro-level (agent) aspects of systems. The methodology is founded on theview of a system as a computational organisation consisting of various interacting roles. We illustrate the methodology through a casestudy (an agent-based business process management system).},

Thatis, given a program which claims to semantically conform to some agent communication standard, how can we determine whether or not it does indeed conform to it? In this article, we present an expressive agent communication lan-guage, and give a semantics for this language in such a way that verifying semantic conformance becomes a realistic possibility. The techniques we develop draw upon those used to give a semantics to reactive systems in theoretical computer science. To illustrate the approach, we give an example of a simple agent system, and show that it does indeed respect the semantics},

We formulate this problem as a multi-agent game with the players being agents purchasing service from a common server. We show that there exists a computable Nash equilibrium when agents have perfect information into the future. From our game, we build a market-based CPU allocation policy and a strategy with which an agent may plan its expenditures for a multi-hop itinerary. We simulate a network of hosts and agents using our strategy to show that our resource-allocation mechanism effectively prioritizes agents according to their endowments and that our planning algorithm handles network delay gracefully.},

The profit-seeking agents, however, risks inefficient allocation of goods and services, as agents take strategic stances that might back fire. While it woiuld be good if we could impose mechanisms to remove incentives for strategic reasoning, this is not possible in the UMDL. Therefore, our approach has instead been to study whether encouraging the other extreme - making strategic reasoning ubiquitous- provides an answer. Towards this end, we have designed a strategy (called the p-strategy) that uses a stochastic model of the market to find the best offer price. We have then examined the collective behaviour of p-strategy agents in the UMDL auction. Our experiments show that strategic thinking is not always beneficial and that the advantage of being strategic decreases with the arrival of equally strategic agents. Furthermore, a simpler strategy can be as effective when enough other agents ise the p-strategy. Consequently, we expect the UMDL is likelu to evlove to a point where some agents use simpler strategies and some use the p-strategy.},

That is, a set of prices (one price for each commodity) is updated until supply meets demand for each commodity. In some cases such as an approach is rather inefficient, and a resource-oriented scheme can be highly competitive. In a resource-oriented shceme the allocations are up-dated until the market equilibrium is found. It is well known that in two-commodity market resource-oriented schemes are possible. In this article we show that resource-oriented allgorithms can be used for the general multicommodity case as well, and present and analyze an algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented and some performance properties, for a specific example, are presented.},

Such agents cannot be coordinated by externally imposing their strategies. INstead the interaction protocols have to be designed so that each agent is motivated to follow the strategy that the protocol designer wants it to follow. This paper reviews six component technologies that we have developed for making such interactions less manipulable and more efficient in terms of the computational processes and the outcomes: {\i}tem OCSM - contracts in marginal cost based contracting, {\i}tem leveled committment contacts, {\i}tem anytime coalition structure generation with worse case guarantees, {\i}tem trading off computation cost against optimisation quality within each coalition, {\i}tem distribution search among insincere agents, and {\i}tem unenforced contract execution. Each of these technologies represents a different way of battling self-interest and combinatorial complexity simultaneously. This is a key battle when multi-agent systems move into large-scale open settings.},

JKQML allows the exchange of information and services between software systems, creating loosely coupled distributed systems. Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) is an agent communication language that is used in systems ranging from research experimental systems to real business production systems. Common attributes of agents include reactivity, autonomy, collaborative behavior, communication ability, mobility, and so on. Software agents must communicate with other agents in order to work flexibly and autonomously. JKQML provides flexibility for the extension of the framework, and it supports the following three protocols: KTP (KQML transfer protocol), a socket-based transport protocol for a KQML message represented in ASCII, ATP (agent transfer protocol), a protocol for KQML messages transferred by a mobile agent that is implemented by Aglets, and OTP (object transfer protocol), a transfer protocol for Java objects that are contained in a KQML message. JKQML is based on the 1996 proposal for a new KQML specification.},

The agent architecture is based on an existing generic agent model, and includes explicit formal conceptual representations of both design structures of agents and (behavioural) properties of agents that can be used as requirements. The process of deliberation is modelled as a design process, based on an existing generic design model. To actually create a new agent at run-time on the basis of the design results, the agent executes a creation action in the material world, which leads to a world state update to include the new agent, after which the new agent functions within the multi-agent system. This approach enables the design of evolution processes in societies of agents for which the evolution is not a merely material process which takes place in isolation from the mental worlds of the agents, but allows for interaction between mental and material processes. A combined mind-matter approach results in which the agents in a society can deliberatively influence the direction of the evolution, comparable to the potential offered by genetic engineering. The architecture has been designed using the compositional development method DESIRE, and has been tested in a prototype implementation.},
