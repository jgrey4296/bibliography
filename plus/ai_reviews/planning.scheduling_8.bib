 abstract     = {There exists a large body of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research on generating plans, i.e., linear or nonlinear sequences of actions, to transform an initial world state to some desired goal state. However, much of the planning research to date has been complicated, ill-understood, and unclear. Only a few of the developers of these planners have provided a thorough description of their research products, and those descriptions that exist are usually unrealistically favorable since the range of applications for which the systems are tested is limited to those for which they were developed. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate these planners and to choose the best planner for a different domain. To make a planner applicable to different planning problems, it should be domain independent. However, one needs to know the circumstances under which a general planner works so that one can determine its suitability for a specific domain. This paper presents criteria for evaluating AI planners; these criteria fall into three categories: (1) performance issues, (2) representational issues, and (3) communication issues. This paper also assesses four nonlinear AI planners (NOAH, NONLIN, SIPE, and TWEAK).},

 abstract     = {While there has been recent interest in research on planning and reasoning about actions, nearly all research results have been theoretical. We know of no previous examples of a planning system that has made a significant impact on a problem of practical importance. One of the primary goals during the development of the SIPE-2 planning system has been the balancing of efficiency with expressiveness and flexibility. With a major new extension, SIPE-2 has begun to address practical problems. This paper describes this new extension and the new applications of the planner. One of these applications is the problem of producing products from raw materials on process lines under production and resource constraints. This is a problem of commercial importance and SIPE-2's application to it is described in some detail.},
