We also show both theoretically and experimentally the super-linear speed-up that results from having a diverse collection of skills among the cooperating agents. Our results suggest an alternative methodology to existing techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems in computer science and distributed artificial intelligence.},

Significantly, fluid organizations can display long cycles of sustained cooperation interrupted by short bursts of defection.},

 abstract     = {The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4 (IMAP4) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. IMAP4 permits manipulation of remote message folders, called ''mailboxes'', in a way that is functionally equivalent to local mailboxes. IMAP4 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server. IMAP4 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes; checking for new messages; permanently removing messages; setting and clearing flags; RFC 822 and MIME parsing; searching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers (relative position from 1 to the number of messages in the mailbox) or unique identifiers (immutable, strictly ascending values assigned to each message, but which are not necessarily contiguous). IMAP4 supports a single server. A mechanism for supporting multiple IMAP4 servers is in progress. IMAP4 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP. IMAP4 is designed to be upwards compatible from the IMAP2 protocol. Compatibility issues are discussed in RFC 1732. This RFC is a product of the Internet Message Access Protocol Working Group of the IETF.},

 abstract     = {We present a two-level model of organizational training and agent production. Managers decide whether or not to train based on both the costs of training compared to the benefits and on their expectations and observations of the number of other firms that also train. Managers also take into account the sum of their employees' contributions and the average tenure length within their organization. Employees decide whether or not to contribute to production based on their expectations as to how other employees will act. Trained workers learn over time and fold their increased productivity into their decision whether or not to contribute. We find that the dynamical behavior at the two levels is closely coupled: the evolution of the industry over time depends not only on the characteristics of training programs, learning curves, and cost-benefit analyses, but on the vagaries of chance as well. For example, in one case, the double dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity then increases steadily over time. In another, the organizational level dilemma may remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In this case the overall productivity stays low. We also find a correlation between high productivity and low turnover and show that a small increase in training rates can lead to explosive growth in productivity.},

 abstract     = {The identification, design, and implementation of strategies for cooperation is a central research issue in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). We propose a novel approach to the construction of cooperation strategies for a group of problem solvers based on the Genetic Programming (GP) paradigm. GP's are a class of adaptive algorithms used to evolve solution structures that optimize a given evaluation criterion. Our approach is based on designing a representation for cooperation strategies that can be manipulated by GPs. We present results from experiments in the predator-prey domain, which has been extensively studied as an easy-to-describe but difficult-to-solve cooperation problem domain. They key aspect of our approach is the minimal reliance on domain knowledge and human intervention in the construction of good cooperation strategies. Promising comparison results with prior systems lend credence to the viability of this approach.},

 abstract     = {The Genetic Programming Algorithm is used to construct an Autonomous Agent capable of learning how to survive a hostile environment. Randomly generated programs, which control the interaction of the Agent with its environment, are recombined to form better programs. Each generation of the population of Agents is placed into the Simulator with the ultimate goal of producing an Agent capable of surviving any environment. The Simulator determines the raw fitness of each Agent by interpreting the associated program. General programs are evolved to solve this problem. Different environmental setups are presented to show the generality of the solution. Certain constructs always appear to facilitate the solution of subproblems of the task. This is evidenced in similar responses of the Average Fitness per Generation curves for the different runs.},
