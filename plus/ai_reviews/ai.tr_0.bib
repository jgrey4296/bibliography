 abstract     = {To accommodate polymorphic data types and operations, several computer scientists - most notably MacQueen, Plotkin, and Sethi {\textendash} have proposed formalizing types as ideas. Although this approach is intuitively appealing, the resulting type system is both complex and restrictive because the type constructor that creates function types in [sic] not monotonic, and hence not computable. As a result, types cannot be treated as data values, precluding the formalization of type constructors and polymorphic program modules (where types are values) as higher order computable functions. Moreover, recursive definitions of new types do not necessarily have solutions. .sp sp This paper proposes a new formulation of types {\textendash} called intervals{\textendash} that subsumes the theory of types as ideals, yet avoids the pathologies caused by non-monotonic type constructors. In particular, the set of interval types contains the set of ideal types as a proper subset and all the primitive type operations on intervals are extensions of the corresponding operations on ideas. Nevertheless, all of the primitive interval type constructors including the function type constructor and type quantifiers are computable operations. Consequently, types are higher order data values that can be freely manipulated within programs.},

 abstract     = {Non-hierarchical statistical decision algorithms spend a significant portion of their time entertaining incorrect hypotheses in multiple class, pattern recognition problems. Maximum-likelihood multivariatie-Gaussian (MLMVG) hypotheses testing is a common example of such a statistical pattern rognition technique. It is shown that the use of out of class covariance matrices can significantly reduce the run-time computations required to make MLMVG decisions. The Analysis directly leads to an objective dimensionality reduction (ODR) technique that indicate the preferred, intrinsic dimensionality omultiple class decision spaces given the training data. Run-time computatio/ns are reduced even further using these reduced dimension class decision spaces with dimensionality reduction technique to stress the essential concepts of out-of-class covariance. The theory has been applied to a nine(9) class, twenty-seven (27) feature, automatic visual solder joint inspection problem with excellent results; run-time computations are reduced by more than a factor of three while maintaining excellent design performance.},
