 abstract     = {MEDIT, a World Wide Web-based environment, aims at offering complementary support to traditional educational practices. The MEDIT approach distinguishes a set of virtual working spaces and provides the appropriate services for each of them. In addition to a generic hypermedia authoring system, designers implemented advanced tools for multiple view representation of a course and creation and maintenance of private workspaces, in order to stimulate information exchange, interaction, and collaborative work among users. The project, which is currently under evaluation through three undergraduate courses in the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, is described in this paper. The first section highlights the development of a mUltidisciplinary Web-based environment, including pedagogical issues in distance education, usability issues of human computer interaction, and technical issues of developing and producing large hypermedia authoring systems. The next section discusses in detail the features of automatic creation of a virtual course space and one of the important pedagogical issues addressed in the MEDIT system{\textendash}the course customization and views. The final section discusses implications of the distance education implemented and plans for future work. Four figures present screens of the course spaces, the semantic view in tree format, interface to access the semantic view, and private workspace creation. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/AEF)},

The aim of Prolab II project is to design and to integrate into a real car a driver support system, or a co-pilot, with several perception devices, real-time decision capabilities and a dedicated human machine interface. The objective of the co-pilot is to provide a support to the driver either in form of useful help messages or by producing meaningful and accurately timed warnings. Our work concerns the real-time decision capabilities of the co-pilot which are intended to analyze the current situation and to generate to the driver warnings, advice or suggestions of possible manoeuvres according to the current situation of the world.},

 abstract     = {We propose a novel similarity measure for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). This measure calculates the Bayes probability of error for HMM state correspondences and propagates it along the Viterbi path in a similar way to the HMM Viterbi scoring. It can be applied as a tool to interpret misclassifications, as a stop criterion in iterative HMM training or as a distance measure for HMM clustering. The similarity measure is evaluated in the context of online handwriting recognition on lower case character models which have been trained from the UNIPEN database. We compare the similarities with experimental classifications. The results show that similar and misclassified class pairs are highly correlated. The measure is not limited to handwriting recognition, but can be used in other applications that use HMM based methods.},

 abstract     = {In this contribution we describe a novel classification approach for on-line handwriting recognition. The technique combines dynamic time warping (DTW) and support vector machines (SVMs) by establishing a new SVM kernel. We call this kernel DTW (GDTW) kernel. This kernel approach has a main advantage over common HMM techniques. It does not assume a model for the generative class conditional densities. Instead, it directly addresses the problem of discrimination by creating class boundaries and thus is less sensitive to modeling assumptions. By incorporating DTW in the kernel function, general classification problems with variable-sized sequential data can be handled. In this respect the proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems, where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure, e.g.~speech recognition or genome processing. We show experiments with this kernel approach on the UNIPEN handwriting data, achieving results comparable to an HMM-based technique.},

 abstract     = {New needs and emerging societal constraints have put the emphasis on the inadequacy of the actual electrical grid. Indeed, it is impossible, or at least very hard, to (i) integrate renewable energy sources at a great scale within the actual electric grid, (ii) enable communications between the various power suppliers and consumers, (iii) design several different services that meet the needs of a wide range of end users. A key solution to these issues consists in using Smart Grids (SG). SG can efficiently control power flows by means of Information Technology (IT). Technically, a SG consists of a power system and a bidirectional communication system. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) constitute a possible technology that can be applied to control and monitor the operation of power grids. Moreover, MAS exhibit distribution, adaptive and intelligent features. The goal of this paper is to propose a framework of qualification and evaluation for comparison SG approaches. First, a set of features of importance for smart grids definition is identified. Then, in a second step, some criteria are given to evaluate the impact of SG on the society. Finally, these features are applied to existing MAS approaches addressing SG in order to understand and compare their different contributions.},

In particular, the production flow control (PFC) in a factory has to be optimized by a decision support system. PFC is a sophisticated process influenced by complex factory structure and high dynamism of manufacturing processes. In order to support PFC we developed a system based on concepts of multi-agent systems and constraint techniques. With this system it is possible to simulate arbitrary production scenarios and to compute their effects on necessary production settings. The user thus receives decision support which may be used during operational planning in logistics as well as in development of new logistics strategies.},

In this paper, we argue that production sequencing may fruitfully be considered as a negotiation problem, in which production cells within a factory negotiate over product sequences in order to fairly distribute costs. We begin by describing and formally defining the production sequencing problem, and present an analysis of it using the tools of game and negotiation theory. We then define a negotiation algorithm for production sequencing, and discuss what assumptions and simplifications must be made in order to make this algorithm suitable for implementation. We conclude by discussing issues for future work},

The main difficulty is to predict the effects of local decisions on the overall plant performance. In this paper, we present a framework for developing planning systems that compute plant-wide consistent production programs and thus master the effects of local decisions. In cooperation with a logistics department of Mercedes-Benz AG, the framework was applied to a subtask of the overall planning problem. We report on the design and the test of the prototype at a plant. Based on the experience with the prototype, we evaluate the framework and discuss how it meets the end-users' requirements.},

Artificial intelligence and software engineering researchers alike are tantalized by the promise of ubiquitously discovering and incorporating services into their own business processes (i.e. composition and orchestration). With growing acceptance of service.oriented computing, an emerging area of research is the investigation of technologies that will enable the discovery and composition of web services. The web Services Challenge (WSC) is a forum where academic and industry researchers can share experiences of developing tools that automate the integration of Web services. In the fourth year (i.e. WSC-08) of the Web Service Challenge, software platforms will address several new composition challenges. Requests and results will be transmitted within SOAP messages. In addition, semantics will be represented in WSDL, and service orchestration will be represented in WS-BPEL.},

This is eventually used by a mobile robot to approach and start interaction with humans. Unlike other similar applications, our solution works well in real-time even under limited computational resources. Experimental results show good performances of our system.},

 abstract     = {Medical Telesurvey needs human operator assistance by smart information systems. This paper deals with the sound event detection in a noisy environment and presents a first classification approach. Detection is the first step of our sound analysis system and is necessary to extract the significant sounds before initiating the classification step. An algorithm based on the Wavelet Transform is evaluated in noisy environment. Then Wavelet based cepstral coefficients are proposed and their results are compared with more classical parameters. Detection algorithm and sound classification methods are applied to medical telemonitoring. In our opinion, microphones surveying life sounds are better preserving patient privacy than video cameras.},
