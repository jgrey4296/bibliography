As a result we show that ecosystems with unstructured cooperative interactions between arbitrary species can be less stable than had been previously determined. We also examine hierarchical ecologies, and demonstrate their increased stability under certain conditions.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the quantitative improvements that result from cooperation. A number of experimental results are presented on constraint satisfaction that both test the predictions of a theory of cooperative problem solving and provide an assessment of the value of cooperation for this class of problems. These experiments suggest an alternative methodology to existing techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems in computer science and distributed artificial intelligence.},
