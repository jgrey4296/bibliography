The machine features two-stage pipelining, a triple bus interconnection data path and support for concurrent control of micro-operations. The objective of this design is to improve execution of a Prolog processor by simultaneously performing multiple micro-operations. Capabilities of concurrent operation support are described in detail and demonstrated using some example Prolog functions. Two-stage pipeline technique as applied to non-deterministic control of Prolog program execution will be presented. .br br 37 pages.....\$4.35},

We argue that multiple techniques are needed and that their use {\textendash} and underlying assumptions {\textendash} should be made explicit. We identify some of the techniques used in MYCIN's therapy selection algorithm to integrate the diverse goals it attempts to satisfy, and suggest how knowledge of such techniques could be used to support construction, explanation, and maintenance of expert systems.},

The logical expressions are interpreted by the generator using the knowledge base and a restricted, but efficient, hybrid knowledge representation system. The success of this experiment has led to plans for the inclusion of this design in both the evolving Penman natural language generator and the Janus natural language interface.},
