 abstract     = {This paper presents studies of the coordination f voluntary human arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multi-joint arm movements. Coordination is modelled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system, and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed.},

 abstract     = {Electron microscope studies of relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the CAT have shown that the retinal input of X-cells is associated with a special synaptic circuitry, termed the spine-triad complex. The retinal afferents make an asymmetrical synapse with both a dendritic appendage of the X-cell and a geniculate interneuron. The interneuron contacts in turn the same dendritic appendage with a symmetrical synaptic profile. The retinal input to geniculate Y-cells is predominately found on dendritic shafts without any triadic arrangement. We explore the integrative properties of X- and Y-cells resulting from this striking dichotomy in synaptic architecture. The basis of our analysis is the solution of the cable equation for a branched dendritic tree with a known somatic input resistance. Under the assumption that the geniculate interneuron mediates a shunting inhibition, activation of the interneuron reduces very efficiently the excitatory post-synaptic potential induced by the retinal afferent without affecting the electrical activity in the rest of the cell. Therefore, the spine-triad circuit implements the analogy of an AND-NOT gate, unique to the X-system. Functionally, this corresponds to a presynaptic, feed-forward type of inhibition of the optic tract terminal. Since Y-cells lack this structure, inhibition acts globally, reducing the general electrical activity of the cell. We propose that geniculate interneurons gate the flow of visual information into the X-system as a function of the behavioral state of the animal, enhancing the center-surround antagonism and possibly mediating reciprocal lateral inhibition, eye-movement related suppression and selective visual attention.},

While modern transformational grammar has largely abandoned complex, language- specific rule systems in favor of modular subsystems of principles and parameters, the rule systems that underlie existing natural- language parsers are still large, detailed, and complicated. The shift to modular theories in linguistics took place because of the scientific disadvantages of such rule systems. Those scientific ills translate into engineering maladies that make building natural- language systems difficult. The cure for these problems should be the same in parser design as it was in linguistic theory. The shift to modular theories of syntax should be replicated in parsing practice; a parser should base its actions on interacting modules of principles and parameters rather than a complex, monolithic rule system. If it can be successfully carried out, the shift will make it easier to build natural-language systems because it will shorten and simplify the language descriptions that are needed for parsing. It will also allow parser design to track new developments in linguistic theory.},

All movements, whether curved or straight, showed an invariant tangential velocity profile when normalized for speed and distance. The velocity profile invariance with speed and load is interpreted in terms of simplification of the underlying arm dynamics, extending the results of Hollerbach and Flash (1982).},

This happens, for example, when the surface is known to be Lambertian, but the direction to the light source is not known. We give an iterative algorithm that alternately estimates the surface shape and the light source direction. Use of the unit normal in parameterizing the reflectance map, rather than the gradient or stereographic coordinates, simpliflies the analysis. Our approach also leads to an iterative scheme for computing shape from shading that adjusts the current estimates of the focal normals toward or away from the direction of the light source. The amount of adjustment is proportional to the current difference between the predicted and the observed brightness. We also develop generalizations to less constrained forms of reflectance maps.},

Understanding of this interaction and the appropriate reasoning is based on a type of non-monotonic logic. We will try, within this paper, to see the effect of two diseases on each other. One important part of the effect of two diseases on each other is the entrancing effect of what we call ''Censors.'' In addition, causal reasoning, reasoning by analogy, and learning from precedents are important and necessary for a human-like expert in medicine.

 abstract     = {The low-level interpretation of images provides constraints on 3D surface shape at multiple resolutions, but typically only at scattered locations over the visual field. Subsequent visual processing can be facilitated substantially if the scattered shape constraints are immediately transformed into visible-surface representations that unambiguously specify surface shape at every image point. The required transformation is shown to lead to an ill-posed surface reconstruction problem. A well-posed variational principle formulation is obtained by invoking 'controlled continuity,' a physically nonrestrictive (generic) assumption about surfaces which is nonetheless strong enough to guarantee unique solutions. The variational principle, which admits an appealing physical interpretation, is locally discretized by applying the finite element method to a piecewise, finite element representation of surfaces. This forms the mathematical basis of a unified and general framework for computing visible-surface representations. The computational framework unifies formal solutions to the key problems of (i) integrating multiscale constraints on surface depth and orientation from multiple visual sources, (ii) interpolating these scattered constraints into dense, piecewise smooth surfaces, (iii) discovering surface depth and orientation discontinuities and allowing them to restrict interpolation appropriately, and (iv) overcoming the immense computational burden of fine resolution surface reconstruction. An efficient surface reconstruction algorithm is developed. It exploits multiresolution hierarchies of cooperative relaxation processes and is suitable for implementation on massively parallel networks of simple, locally interconnected processors. The algorithm is evaluated empirically in a diversity of applications.},

Hence, they converge extremely slowly when confronted by the large representations necessary for low- level vision. Application of multigrid methods can overcome this drawback, as we established in previous work on 3-D surface reconstruction. In this paper, we develop efficient multiresolution iterative algorithms for computing lightness, shape-from-shading, and optical flow, and we evaluate the performance of these algorithms on Synthetic images. The multigrid methodology that we describe is broadly applicable in low-level vision. Notably, it is an appealing strategy to use in conjunction with regularization analysis for the efficient solution of a wide range of ill- posed visual reconstruction problems.},

One method is to filter the projection data first, and then backproject this filtered data and sum over all projection directions. The other method is to backproject and sum the projection data first, and then filter. The two methods are mathematically equivalent, producing very similar equations. We will derive the reconstruction formulas for both methods for any number of dimensions. We will examine the cases of two and three dimensions, since these are the only ones encountered in practice. The equations are very different for these cases. In general, the equations are very different for even and odd dimensionality.

The learning system successfully generated and refined na''{\i}ve causal models of these simple physical systems. The causal models which emerge from the learning process support causal reasoning- explanation, prediction, and planning. Inaccurate predictions and failed plans in turn indicate deficiencies in the causal models and the need to re- hypothesize. Thus learning supports reasoning which leads to further learning. The learning system makes use of standard inductive rules of inference as well as the constraints on causal hypotheses to generalize its causal models.

His algorithm uses ID and LP constraints directly in language processing, without expanding them into a context-free ''object grammar.'' This report examines the computational difficulty of ID/LP parsing. Shieber`s purported O (G square times n cubed) runtime bound underestimated the difficulty of ID/LP parsing; the worst-case runtime of his algorithm is exponential in size. A reduction of the vertex-cover problem proves that ID/LP parsing is NP-complete. The growth of the internal data structures is the source of difficulty in Shieber`s algorithm. The computational and linguistic implications of these results are discussed. Despite the potential for combinatorial explosion, Shieber`s algorithm remains better than the alternative of parsing an expanded object grammar.},

 abstract     = {We develop a systematic approach to the discovery of parallel iterative schemes for solving the shape-from-shading problem on a grid. A standard procedure for finding such schemes is outlines, and subsequently used to derive several new ones. The shape-from- shading problem is known to be mathematically equivalent to a non-linear first- order partial differential equation in surface elevation. To avoid the problems inherent in methods used to solve such equations, we follow previous work in reformulating the problem as one of finding a surface orientation field that minimizes the integral of the brightness error. The calculus of variations is then employed to derive the appropriate Euler equations on which iterative schemes can be based. The problem of minimizing the integral of the brightness error term it ill posed, since it has an infinite number of solutions in terms of surface orientation fields. A previous method used a regularization technique to overcome this difficulty. An extra term was added to the integral to obtain an approximation to a solution that was as smooth as possible. We point out here that surface orientation has to obey an integrability constraint if it is to correspond to an underlying smooth surface. Regularization methods do not guarantee that the surface orientation recovered satisfies this constraint. Consequently, we attempt to develop a method that enforces integrability, but fail to find a convergent iterate scheme based on the resulting Euler equations. We show, however, that such a scheme can be derived if, instead of strictly enforcing the constraint, a penalty term derived from the constraint is adopted. This new scheme, while it can be expressed simply and elegantly using the surface gradient, unfortunately cannot deal with constraints imposed by occluding boundaries. These constraints are crucial if ambiguities in the solution of the shape-from shading problem are to be avoided, Different schemes result if one uses different parameters to describe surface orientation We derive two new schemes, using unit surface normals, that facilitate the incorporation of the occluding boundary information. These schemes, while more complex, have several advantages over previous ones.},

 abstract     = {This paper explores the relationships between a computation theory of temporal representation (as developed by James Allen) and a formal linguistic theory of tense (as developed by Norbert Hornstein) and aspect. It aims to provide explicit answers to four fundamental questions: (1) what is the computational justification for the primitive of a linguistic theory; (2) what is the computational explanation of the formal grammatical constraints; (3) what are the processing constraints imposed on the learnability and markedness of these theoretical constructs; and (4) what are the constraints that a linguistic theory imposes on representations. We show that one can effectively exploit the interface between the language faculty and the cognitive faculties by using linguistic constraints to determine restrictions on the cognitive representation and vice versa. Three main results are obtained: (1) We derive an explanation of an observed grammatical constraint on tense{\textemdash}the Linear Order Constraint{\textemdash}from the information monotonicity property of the constraint propagation algorithm of Allen`s temporal system: (2) We formulate a principle of markedness for the basic tense structures based on the computational efficiency of the temporal representations; and (3) We show Allen`s interval-based temporal system is not arbitrary, but it can be used to explain independently motivated linguistic constraints on tense and aspect interpretations. We also claim that the methodology of research developed in this study{\textemdash}''cross- level'' investigation of independently motivated formal grammatical theory and computational models{\textemdash}is a powerful paradigm with which to attack representational problems in basic cognitive domains, e.g., space, time, causality, etc.},

First, several new FORMAT directives are provided which support dynamic decisions about the placement of newlines based on the line width available for output. Second, the concept of print-self methods is extended so that it can be applied to lists as well as to objects which can receive messages. Together, these extensions support pretty printing of both programs and data structures. The PP system also modifies the way that the Lisp printer handles the abbreviation of output. The traditional mechanisms for abbreviating lists based on nesting depth and length are extended so that they automatically apply to every kind of structure without the user having to take any explicit action when writing print-self methods. A new abbreviation mechanism introduced which can be used to limit the total number of lines printed.},

This happens, for example, when the surface is known to be Lambertian, but the direction to the light source is not known. We give an iterative algorithm that alternately estimates the surface shape and the light source direction. Use of the unit normal in parameterizing the reflectance map, rather than the gradient or stereographic coordinates, simpliflies the analysis. Our approach also leads to an iterative scheme for computing shape from shading that adjusts the current estimates of the focal normals toward or away from the direction of the light source. The amount of adjustment is proportional to the current difference between the predicted and the observed brightness. We also develop generalizations to less constrained forms of reflectance maps.},

The method works by extracting straight segments from the range data and examining all hypotheses about pairings between the segments and walls in the model of the room. Inconsistent pairings are discarded efficiently by using local constraints based on distances between walls, angles between walls, and ranges between walls along their normal vectors. These constraints are used to obtain a small set of possible positions, which is further pruned using a test for physical consistency. The approach is extremely tolerant of noise and clutter. Transient objects such as furniture and people need not be included in the room model, and very noisy, low- resolution sensors can be used. The algorithm`s performance is demonstrated using Polaroid Ultrasonic Rangefinder, which is a low-resolution, high-noise sensor.},

I have been studying the phenomena of routinization, the process by which institutionalized patterns of interaction with the world arise and evolve in everyday life. Underlying this evolution is a dialectical process of internalization. First you build a model of some previously unarticulated emergent aspect of an existing routine. Armed with an incrementally more global view of interaction, you can often formulate an incrementally better informed plan of attack. A routine is not a plan in the sense of the classical planning literature, except in the theoretical limit of this process. I am implementing this theory using running arguments, a technique for writing rule-based programs for intelligent agents. Because a running argument is compiled into TMS networks as it proceeds, incremental changes in the world require only incremental recomputation of the reasoning about what actions to take next. The system supports a style of programming, dialectival argumentation that had many important properties that recommend it as a substrate for large AI systems. One of these might be called additivity: an agent can modify its reasoning in a class of situations by adducing arguments as to why its previous arguments were incorrect in those cases. Because no side-effects are ever required, reflexive systems based on dialectical argumentation ought to be less fragile than intuition and experience suggest.

In the case of exact data, one of the standard regularization methods (see Poggio and Torre, 1984) leads to cubic spline interpolation before differentiation. We show that in the case of regularly-spaced data this solution corresponds to a convolution filter{\textemdash}to be applied to the signal before differentiation {\textendash} which is a cubic spline. In the case of non-exact data, we use another regularization method that leads to a different variational principle. We prove (1) that this variational principle leads to a convolution filter for the problem of one-dimensional edge detection, (2) that the form of this filter is very similar to the Gaussian filter, and (3) that the regularizing parameter $lambda$ in the variational principle effectively controls the scale of the filter.},

This longstanding, widely assumed GPSG ''efficient parsability'' result in misleading: parsing the sentences of an arbitrary GPSG is likely to be intractable, because a reduction from 3SAT proves that the universal recognition problem for the GPSGs of Gazdar (1981) is NP-hard. Crucially, the time to parse a sentence of a CFL can be the product of sentence length cubed and context-free grammar size squared, and the GPSG grammar can result in an exponentially large set of derived context-free rules. A central object in the 1981 GPSG theory, the metarule, inherently results in an intractable parsing problem, even when severely constrained. The implications for linguistics and natural language parsing are discussed.},

We use the representation to decompose the intersection algorithms into two steps: the localization of intersections, and their processing. When dealing with polyhedra with many faces (typically more than one thousand), the first step is by far the most expensive. The Prism Tree structure is used to compute efficiently this localization step. A preliminary implementation of the Set Operations and Ray casting algorithms has been constructed.},

Ullman (1984) recently proposed a computational scheme, the incremental rigidity scheme, which uses the rigidity assumptions to recover the structure of rigid and non-rigid objects in motion. The scheme assumes the input to be discrete positions of elements in motion, under orthographic projection. We present formulations of Ullmans` method that use velocity information and perspective projection in the recovery of structure. Theoretical and computer analyses show that the velocity based formulations provide a rough estimate of structure quickly, but are not robust over an extended time period. The stable long term recovery of structure requires disparate views of moving objects. Our analysis raises interesting questions regarding the recovery of structure from motion in the human visual system.},

In this paper, we examine techniques for acquiring position and surface orientation data about points on the surfaces of objects, with the intent of selecting sensory points that will force a unique interpretation of the pose of the object with as few data points as possible. Under some simple assumptions about the sensing geometry, we derive a technique for predicting optimal sensing positions. The technique has been implemented and tested. To fully specify the algorithm, we need estimates of the error in estimating the position and orientation of the object, and we derive analytic expressions for such error for the case of one particular approach to object recognition.},

 abstract     = {Variable precision logic is concerned with problems of reasoning with incomplete information and under time constraints. It offers mechanisms for handling trade-offs between the precision of inferences and the computational efficiency of deriving them. Of the two aspects of precision, the specificity of conclusions and the certainty of belief in them, we address here primarily the latter, and employ censored production rules as an underlying representational and computational mechanism. Such rules are created by augmenting ordinary production rules with an exception condition and are written in the form if A then D unless C, where C is the exception condition. From a control viewpoint, censored production rules are intended for situations in which the implication A arrow B holds frequently and the assertion C holds rarely. Systems using censored production rules are free to ignore the exception conditions, when time is a premium. Given more time, the exception conditions are examined, lending credibility to initial, high-speed answers, or changing them. Such logical systems therefore exhibit variable certainty of conclusions, reflecting variable investments of computational resources in conducting reasoning. From a logical viewpoint, the unless operator between B and C acts as the exclusive-or operator. From an expository viewpoint, the if A then B part of the censored production rule expresses an important information (e.g., a causal relationship), while the unless C part acts only as a switch that changes the polarity of B to {\textendash}B when C holds. Expositive properties are captured quantitatively by augmenting censored rules with two parameters that indicate the certainty of the implication if A then B. Parameter 6 is the certainty when the truth value C is unknown, and 7 is the certainty when C is known to be false.},

The force closure constraint is addressed from three different points of view: mathematics, physics, and computational geometry.

Higher level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory building maps of its surroundings. In this paper we demonstrate the system controlling a detailed simulation of the robot.},

An agent copes with these limitations by applying rules of conjecture to make reasonable assumptions about what is known. Circumscription, proposed by McCarthy, is the formalization of a particularly important rule of conjecture likened to Occam`s razor. That is, the set of all objects satisfying a certain property is the smallest set of objects that is consistent with what is known. This paper examines closely the properties and the semantics underlying circumscription, considering both its expressive power and limitations. In addition we study circumscription`s relationship to several related formalisms, such as negation by failure, the closed world assumption, default reasoning and Planner`s THNOT. In the discussion a number of extensions to circumscription are proposed, allowing one to tightly focus its scope of applicability. In addition, several new rules of conjecture are proposed based on the notions of relevance and minimality. Finally a synthesis between the approaches of McCarthy and Konolige is used to extend circumscription, as well as several other rules of conjecture, to account for resource limitations.},

The current analysis extends the analysis of the planar velocity field in four directions: (1) the use of flow parameters of the type suggested by Koenderink and van Doorn (1975), (2) the exclusion of confusable non-planar solutions, (3) a new proof and a new method for computing the 3D motion and surface orientation, and (4) a comparison with the information available in orthographic velocity fields, which is important for determining the stability of the 3D recovery process.},

The recognition and generation of visual objects from symbolic descriptions aare two sides of the same coin. A paradigm for the discovery and validation of higher-level visual properties is introduced. The paradigm involves two aspects. One is the notion of denotation: the map between symbolic descriptions and visual properties. The denotation map can be validated by focus on the conversation between users and a system. The second aspect involves a method for discovering a natural rich set of visual primitives. The notion of visual property is expanded, and the paradigm is further illustrated with a traditional business graphics example.},

Under what condidtions can such useful categories be created? We propose a solution which requires 1.) that modes or clusters of natural structures are present in the world, and, 2.) that the physical properties of these structures are reflected in the sensory data used by the observer for classification. Given these two constraints, we explore the type of additional knowledge sufficient for the observer to generate an internal representation that makes explicit the natural modes.

One method chooses the joint acceleration null-space vector to minimize joint torque in a least squares sense; when the least squares is weighted by allowable torque range, the joint torques tend to be kept within their limits. Contrasting methods employing only the pseudoinverse with and without weighting by the inertia matrix are presented. The results show an unexpected stability problem during long trajectories for the null-space methods and for the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse method, but rarely for the unweighted pseudoinverse method. Evidently a whiplash action develops over time that thrusts the endpoint off the intended path, and extremely high torques are required to overcome these natural movement dynamics.},

First, existing programs have similar mechanisms for generating and testing fault hypotheses. Second, most of these systems have similar built-in assumptions about both the devices being diagnosed and their failure modes; these assumptions in turn limit the generality of the programs. The purpose of this paper is to identify the problems and non- problems in model based troubleshooting. The non-problems are in generating and testing fault hypotheses about misbehaving components in simple static devices; a small core of largely equivalent techniques covers the apparent profusion of existing approaches. The problems occur with devices that aren't static, aren't simple and whose components fail in ways current programs don't hypothesize and hence can't diagnose.},

 abstract     = {An important goal of computational linguistics has been to use linguistic theory to guide the construction of computationally efficient real- world natural language processing systems. At first glance, the entirely new generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) theory of Gazdar, Klein, Pullum, and Sag (1985) appears to be a blessing on two counts. First, their precise formal system and the broad empirical coverage of their published English grammar might be a direct guide for a transparent parser design and implementation. Second, since GPSG has weak context-free generative power and context-free languages can be parsed in O(n3) by a wide range of algorithms, GPSG parsers would appear to run in polynomial time. This widely-assumed GPSG ''efficient parsbility'' result is misleading: here we prove that the universal recognition problem for the new GPSG theory is exponentially-polynomial time hard, and assuredly intractable. The paper pinpoints sources of intractability (e.g. metarules and syntactic features in the GPSG formal system and concludes with some linguistically and computationally motivated restrictions on GPSG.},

I prove that ''=E*?'' is undecidable for GPSGs and, on the basis of this result and the unnaturalness of E*, I argue that GPSG`s three goals and its weak context-free generative power conflict with each other: there is no algorithmic way of knowing whether any given GPSG generates a natural language or an unnatural one. The paper concludes with a diagnosis of the result and suggests that the problem might be met by abandoning the weak context-free framework and assuming substantive constraints.},

The process of reimplementing Lenat's work has already revealed several insights into the nature of Eurisko-like systems in general; these insights are incorporated into the design of Cyrano. Foremost among these new insights is the characterization of Eurisko-like systems (shich I call inquisitive systems) as search processes which dynamically reconfigure their search space by the formation of new concepts and representations. This insight reveals requirements for modularity and 'consistency' in the definition of new concepts and representations.},

The RA is intended to support the earliest phases of creating a requirement, in which incompleteness, ambiguity, and contradiction are inevitable features. From an artificial intelligence perspective, the central problem the RA faces is one of knowledge acquisition. It has to develop a coherent internal representation from an initial set of disorganized statements. To do so, the RA will rely on a variety of techniques, including dependency-directed reasoning, hybrid knowledge representation, and the reuse of common forms (clich'es).

The optical flow, therefore, is ill-suited for computing structure from motion and for reconstructing the 3D velocity field, problems that require an accurate estimate of the 2D motion field. We then suggest a different use of the optical flow. We argue that stable qualitative properties of the 2D motion field give useful information about the 3D velocity field and the 3D structure of the scene, and that they can usually be obtained from the optical flow. To support this approach we show how the (smoothed) optical flow and 2D motion field, interpreted as vector fields tangent to flows of planar dynamical systems, may have the same qualitative properties from the point of view of the theory of structural stability of dynamical systems.},

Early vision includes problems such as the recovery of motion and optical flow, shape from shading, surface interpolation, and edge detection. These are inverse problems, which are often ill-posed or ill-conditioned. We review here the relevant mathematical results on ill-posed and ill- conditioned problems and introduce the formal aspects of regularization theory in the linear and non-linear case. More general stochastic regularization methods are also introduced. Specific topics in early vision and their regularization are then analyzed rigorously, characterizing existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions.},

The first determines the transformation in space that is necessary to bring the viewed object into alignment with possible object-models. The second stage determines the model that best matches the viewed object. The proposed alignment method also uses abstract description, but unlike structural description methods, it uses them pictorially, rather than in symbolic structural descriptions.},

In particular, it is not necessary to re-design quotation, take a stand on the relative merits of evaluation vs. normalization, or treat continuations as meta-level objects. This paper presents a simple programming language interpreter that illustrates how this can be done. By keeping its expression evaluator entirely separate from the mechanisms that implement its infinite tower, this interpreter avoids many troublesome aspects of previous self-referential programming languages. Given these basically straightforward techniques, processor towers might be easily constructed for a wide variety of systems to enable them to manipulate and reason about themselves.},

This report shows how a principle-based parser with a 'co-routine' design improves parsing for translation. The parser consists of a skeletal structure-building mechanism that operates in conjunction with a linguistically based constraint module, passing control back and forth until a set of underspecified skeletal phrase-structures is converted into a fully instantiated parse tree. The modularity of the parsing design accomodates linguistic generalization, reduces the grammar size, allows extension to other languages, and is compatible with studies of human language processing.},

For a formalism to be maximally useful, it must satisfy five key desiderata: expressiveness, convenient combinability, semantic soundness, machine manipulability, and programming language independence. The Plan Calculus formalism developed as part of the Programmer's Apprentice project satisfies each of these desiderata quite well. It does this by combining the ideas from flowchart schemas, data abstraction, logical formalisms, and program transformations. The efficacy of the Plan Calculus has been demonstrated in part by a prototype program editor called the Knowledge- based Editor in Emacs.

 abstract     = {The Voronoi diagram has proved to be a useful tool in a variety of contexts in computational geometry. Our interest here is in using the diagram to simplify the planning of collision-free paths for a robot among obstacles, the so-called generalized movers' problem. The Voronoi diagram, as usually defined, is a strong deformation retract of free space so that free space can be continuously deformed onto the diagram. In particular, any path in free space can be continuously deformed onto the diagram. This means that the diagram is complete for path planning, i.e., searching the original space for paths can be reduced to a search on the diagram. Reducing the dimension of the set to be searched usually reduces the time complexity of the search. Secondly, the diagram leads to robust paths, i.e., paths that are maximally clear of obstacles.},

To do this, I analyze the computational complexity of human language comprehension: what linguistic representation is assigned to a given sound? This problem is factored into smaller, interrelated (but independently statable) problems. For example, in order to understand a given sound, the listener must assign a phonetic form to the sound; determine the morphemes that compose the words in the sound; and calculate the linguistic antecedent of every pronoun in the utterance. I prove that these and other subproblems are all NP-hard, and that language comprehension is itself PSPACE- hard.},

Accumulation of information from shading and stereo and vetoing of depth from shading by edge information have been found. Cooperativity and other types of interactions are discussed. If intensity edges are missing, as in a smooth-shaded surface, the image intensities themselves could be used for stereo matching. The results are compared with computer vision algorithms for both single modules and their integration for 3D vision.},

In this paper we suggest that integration is best performed at the location of discontinuities in early processes, such as discontinuities in image brightness, depth, motion, texture and color. Coupled Markov Random Field models, based on Bayes estimation techiques, can be used to combine vision modalities with their discontinuities. These models generate algorithms that map naturally onto parallel fine-grained architectures such as the Connection Machine. We derive a scheme to integrate intensity edges with stereo depth and motion field information and show results on synthetic and natural images. The use of intensity edges to integrate other visual cues and to help discover discontinuities emerges as a general and powerful principle.},

Estimation of the optical flow requires the application of two kinds of constraint: the flow field smoothness constraint and the brightness constancy constraint. The brightness constancy constraint permits one to match image brightness values across images, but is very restrictive. We propose replacing this constraint with a more general constraint, which permits a linear transformation between image brightness values. The transformation parameters are allowed to vary smoothly so that inexact matching is allowed. We describe the implementation on a highly parallel computer and present sample results.},

The primitive patterns and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the principles which allow their elaboration into more complicated patterns and skeletons. The advantages of the language are that it allows one to apply transformation rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely.},

This report presents an alternative approach to natural language translation that relies on principle-based descriptions of grammar rather than rule-oriented descriptions. The model that has been constructed is based on abstract principles as developed by Chomsky (1981) and several other researchers working within the ''Government and Binding'' (GB) framework. Thus, the grammar is viewed as a modular system of principles rather than a large set of ad hoc language-specific rules.},

 abstract     = {This thesis addresses the problem of categorizing natural objects. To provide a criteria for categorization we propose that the purpose of a categorization is to support the inference of unobserved properties of objects from the observed properties. Because no such set of categories can be constructed in an arbitrary world, we present the Principle of Natural Modes as a claim about the structure of the world. We first define an evaluation function that measures how well a set of categories supports the inference goals of the observer. Entropy measures for property uncertainty and category uncertainty are combined through a free parameter that reflects the goals of the observer. Natural categorizations are shown to be those that are stable with respect to this free parameter. The evaluation function is tested in the domain of leaves and is found to be sensitive to the structure of the natural categories corresponding to the different species. We next develop a categorization paradigm that utilizes the categorization evaluation function in recovering natural categories. A statistical hypothesis generation algorithm is presented that is shown to be an effective categorization procedure. Examples drawn from several natural domains are presented, including data known to be a difficult test case for numerical categorization techniques. We next extend the categorization paradigm such that multiple levels of natural categories are recovered; by means of recursively invoking the categorization procedure both the genera and species are recovered in a population of anaerobic bacteria. Finally, a method is presented for evaluating the utility of features in recovering natural categories. This method also provides a mechanism for determining which features are constrained by the different processes present in a multiple modal world.},

 abstract     = {Methods are developed for predicting vibration response characteristics of systems which change configuration during operation. A cartesian robot, an example of such a position-dependent system, served as a test case for these methods and was studied in detail. The chosen system model was formulated using the technique of Component Mode Synthesis (CMS). The model assumes that he system is slowly varying, and connects the carriages to each other and to the robot structure at the slowly varying connection points. The modal data required for each component is obtained experimentally in order to get a realistic model. The analysis results in prediction of vibrations that are produced by the inertia forces as well as gravity and friction forces which arise when the robot carriages move with some prescribed motion. Computer simulations and experimental determinations are conducted in order to calculate the vibrations at the robot end- effector. Comparisons are shown to validate the model in two ways: for fixed configuration the mode shapes and natural frequencies are examined, and then for changing configuration the residual vibration at the end of the mode is evaluated. A preliminary study was done on a geometrically nonlinear system which also has position-dependency. The system consisted of a flexible four-bar linkage with elastic input and output shafts. The behavior of the rocker-beam is analyzed for different boundary conditions to show how some limiting cases are obtained. A dimensional analysis leads to an evaluation of the consequences of dynamic similarity on the resulting vibration.},

 abstract     = {Dynamic systems which undergo rapid motion can excite natural frequencies that lead to residual vibration at the end of motion. This work presents a method to shape force profiles that reduce excitation energy at the natural frequencies in order to reduce residual vibration for fast moves. Such profiles are developed using a ramped sinusoid function and its harmonics, choosing coefficients to reduce spectral energy at the natural frequencies of the system. To improve robustness with respect to parameter uncertainty, spectral energy is reduced for a range of frequencies surrounding the nominal natural frequency. An additional set of versine profiles are also constructed to permit motion at constant speed for velocity-limited systems. These shaped force profiles are incorporated into a simple closed-loop system with position and velocity feedback. The force input is doubly integrated to generate a shaped position reference for the controller to follow. This control scheme is evaluated on the MIT Cartesian Robot. The shaped inputs generate motions with minimum residual vibration when actuator saturation is avoided. Feedback control compensates for the effect of friction Using only a knowledge of the natural frequencies of the system to shape the force inputs, vibration can also be attenuated in modes which vibrate in directions other than the motion direction. When moving several axes, the use of shaped inputs allows minimum residual vibration even when the natural frequencies are dynamically changing by a limited amount.},

This exactness in the proposed method fixes the repeatability problem in the Resolved Motion Method, and establishes a fixed transformation from workspace to the joint space. Also the method, owing to the exactness, is demonstrated to give more accurate trajectories than the Resolved Motion Method. In addition, a new performance measure for redundancy control has been developed. This measure, if used with kinematic control methods, helps achieve dexterous movements including singularity avoidance. Compared to other measures such as the manipulability measure and the condition number, this measure tends to give superior performances in terms of preserving the repeatability property and providing with smoother joint velocity trajectories. Using the fixed transformation property, Taylor`s Bounded Deviation Paths Algorithm has been extended to the redundant manipulators.},

 abstract     = {The flexibility of the robot is the key to its success as a viable aid to production. Flexibility of a robot can be explained in two directions. The first is to increase the physical generality of the robot such that it can be easily reconfigured to handle a wide variety of tasks. The second direction is to increase the ability of the robot to interact with its environment such that tasks can still be successfully completed in the presence of uncertainties. The use of articulated hands are capable of adapting to a wide variety of grasp shapes, hence reducing the need for special tooling. The availability of low mass, high bandwidth points close to the manipulated object also offers significant improvements I the control of fine motions. This thesis provides a framework for using articulated hands to perform local manipulation of objects. N particular, it addresses the issues in effecting compliant motions of objects in Cartesian space. The Stanford/JPL hand is used as an example to illustrate a number of concepts. The examples provide a unified methodology for controlling articulated hands grasping with point contacts. We also present a high-level hand programming system based on the methodologies developed in this thesis. Compliant motion of grasped objects and dexterous manipulations can be easily described in the LISP-based hand programming language.},

 abstract     = {Control of machines that exhibit flexibility becomes important when designers attempt to push the state of the art with faster, lighter machines. Three steps are necessary for the control of a flexible planet. First, a good model of the plant must exist. Second, a good controller must be designed. Third, inputs to the controller must be constructed using knowledge of the system dynamic response. There is a great deal of literature pertaining to modeling and control but little dealing with the shaping of system inputs. Chapter 2 examines two input shaping techniques based on frequency domain analysis. The first involves the use of the first deriviate of a gaussian exponential as a driving function template. The second, acasual filtering, involves removal of energy from the driving functions at the resonant frequencies of the system. Chapter 3 presents a linear programming technique for generating vibration-reducing driving functions for systems. Chapter 4 extends the results of the previous chapter by developing a direct solution to the new class of driving functions. A detailed analysis of the new technique is presented from five different perspectives and several extensions are presented. Chapter 5 verifies the theories of the previous two chapters with hardware experiments. Because the new technique resembles common signal filtering, chapter 6 compares the new approach to eleven standard filters. The new technique will be shown to result in less residual vibrations, have better robustness to system parameter uncertainty, and require less computation than other currently used shaping techniques.},

This thesis explains the theoretical basis for each technique, describes how they are implemented, and discusses the difference between the two.

This approach can be used either to verify whether some set of space pruning constraints can prune with discrimination or to generate solutions directly. Schedules can be represented as trajectories through a Cartesian space. Under the objective criteria of Minimum maximum Lateness family of ''good'' schedules (trajectories) are geometric neighbors (reside with some ''tube'') in this space. This second method of generating solutions takes advantage of this adjacency by pruning the space from the outside in thus converging gradually upon this ''tube.''

 abstract     = {This report describes a paradigm for combining associational and causal reasoning to achieve efficient and robust problem-solving behavior. The Generate, Test and Debug (GTD) paradigm generates initial hypotheses using associational (heuristic) rules. The tester verifies hypotheses, supplying the debugger with causal explanations for bugs found if the test fails. The debugger uses domain- independent causal reasoning techniques to repair hypotheses, analyzing domain models and the causal explanations produced by the tester to determine how to replace faulty assumptions made by the generator. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of associational and causal reasoning techniques, and present a theory of debugging plans and interpretations. The GTD paradigm has been implemented and tested in the domains of geologic interpretation, the blocks world, and Tower of Hanoi problems.},

A natural functionality set is used to represent the maximum functionalities that a component can have. The current implementation has only primitive domain knowledge and needs other work as well.

 abstract     = {This thesis describes a methodology, a representation, and an implemented program for troubleshooting digital circuit boards at roughly the level of expertise one might expect in a human novice. Existing methods for model-based troubleshooting have not scaled up to deal with complex circuits, in part because traditional circuit models do not explicitly represent aspects of the device that troubleshooters would consider important. For complex devices the model of the target device should be constructed with the goal of troubleshooting explicitly in mind. Given that methodology, the principal contributions of the thesis are ways of representing complex circuits to help make troubleshooting feasible. Temporally coarse behavior descriptions are a particularly powerful simplification. Instantiating this idea for the circuit domain produces a vocabulary for describing digital signals. The vocabulary has a level of temporal detail sufficient to make useful predictions abut the response of the circuit while it remains coarse enough to make those predictions computationally tractable. Other contributions are principles for using these representations. Although not embodied in a program, these principles are sufficiently concrete that models can be constructed manually from existing circuit descriptions such as schematics, part specifications, and state diagrams. One such principle is that if there are components with particularly likely failure modes or failure modes in which their behavior is drastically simplified, this knowledge should be incorporated into the model. Further contributions include the solution of technical problems resulting from the use of explicit temporal representations and design descriptions with tangled hierarchies.},

The MDP presents some unique challenges and opportunities for compilation. Due to the MDP's small memory size, it is critical that the size of the generated code be as small as possible. The MDP is an inherently concurrent processor with efficient mechanisms for sending and receiving messages; the compiler takes advantage of these mechanisms. The MDP's tagged architecture allows very efficient support of object-oriented languages such as Concurrent Smalltalk. The initial goals for the MDP were to have the MDP execute about twenty instructions per method and contain 4096 words of memory. This compiler shows that these goals are too optimistic {\textendash} most methods are longer, both in terms of code size and running time. Thus, the memory size of the MDP should be increased.},

The stable and unstable manifolds of these critical points correspond to convex and concave solution surfaces, giving more general existence and uniqueness results. A new kind of highly parallel, robust shape from shading algorithm is suggested on neighborhoods of these critical points. The information at bounding contours in the image is also analyzed.},

I show that by eliminating inherently sequential data-structure references, partial evaluation exposes the low-level parallelism inherent in a computation. I have implemented several parallel scheduling and analysis programs that study the tradeoffs involved in the design of an architecture that can effectively utilize this parallelism.

This thesis introduces active randomization by a robot, both in selecting actions to execute and in focusing on sensory information to interpret, as a basic tool for overcoming uncertainty. An example of randomization is given by the strategy of shaking a bin containing a part in order to orient the part in a desired stable state with some high probability. Another example consists of first using reliable sensory information to bring two parts close together, then relying on short random motions to actually mate the two parts, once the part motions lie below the available sensing resolution. Further examples include tapping parts that are tightly wedged, twirling gears before trying to mesh them, and vibrating parts to facilitate a mating operation.},

The FICE separates the contribution to the irradiance spatiotemporal gradients of the gradients due to texture from those due to shading and allows the FICE to be used for textured and textureless surface. The new approach, combining motion and shading information, leads directly to two different contributions: it can compensate for the effects of shading variations in recovering the shape and motion; and it can exploit the shading/illumination effects to recover motion and shape when they cannot be recovered without it. The FICE formulation is also extended to multiple frames.},

 abstract     = {Signalling off-chip requires significant current. As a result, a chip's power-supply current changes drastically during certain output-bus transitions. These current fluctuations cause a voltage drop between the chip and circuit board due to the parasitic inductance of the power-supply package leads. Digital designers often go to great lengths to reduce this ''transmitted'' noise. Cray, for instance, carefully balances output signals using a technique called differential signalling to guarantee a chip has constant output current. Transmitted-noise reduction costs Cray a factor of two in output pins and wires. Coding achieves similar results at smaller costs.},

What does the right model mean anyway? Our work has three major components. The first component deals with how we determine whether a piece of information is relevant to solving a problem. We have three ways of determining relevance: derivational, situational and an order-of- magnitude reasoning process. The second component deals with the defining and building of models for solving problems. We identify these models, determine what we need to know about them, and importantly, determine when they are appropriate. Currently, the system has a collection of four basic models and two hybrid models. This collection of models has been successfully tested on a set of fifteen simple kinematics problems.

 abstract     = {The central thesis of this report is that human language is NP-complete. That is, the process of comprehending and producing utterances is bounded above by the class NP, and below by NP-hardness. This constructive complexity thesis has two empirical consequences. The first is to predict that a linguistic theory outside NP is unnaturally powerful. The second is to predict that a linguistic theory easier than NP-hard is descriptively inadequate. To prove the lower bound, I show that the following three subproblems of language comprehension are all NP-hard: decide whether a given sound is possible sound of a given language; disambiguate a sequence of words; and compute the antecedents of pronouns. The proofs are based directly on the empirical facts of the language user`s knowledge, under an appropriate idealization. Therefore, they are invariant across linguistic theories. (For this reason, no knowledge of linguistic theory is needed to understand the proofs, only knowledge of English.) To illustrate the usefulness of the upper bound, I show that two widely-accepted analyses of the language user`s knowledge (of syntactic ellipsis and phonological dependencies) lead to complexity outside of NP (PSPACE-hard and Undecidable, respectively). Next, guided by the complexity proofs, I construct alternate linguisitic analyses that are strictly superior on descriptive grounds, as well as being less complex computationally (in NP). The report also presents a new framework for linguistic theorizing, that resolves important puzzles in generative linguistics, and guides the mathematical investigation of human language.},

 abstract     = {Surface (Lambertain) color is a useful visual cue for analyzing material composition of scenes. This thesis adopts a signal processing approach to color vision. It represents color images as fields of 3D vectors, from which we extract region and boundary information. The first problem we face is one of secondary imaging effects that makes image color different from surface color. We demonstrate a simple but effective polarization based technique that corrects for these effects. We then propose a systematic approach of scalarizing color, that allows us to augment classical image processing tools and concepts for multi-dimensional color signals.},

 abstract     = {This thesis describes an investigation of retinal directional selectivity. We show intracellular (whole-cell patch) recordings in turtle retina which indicate that this computation occurs prior to the ganglion cell, and we describe a pre-ganglionic circuit model to account for this and other findings which places the non-linear spatio-temporal filter at individual, oriented amacrine cell dendrites. The key non-linearity is provided by interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto the dendrites, and their distal tips provide directionally selective excitatory outputs onto ganglion cells. Detailed simulations of putative cells support this model, given reasonable parameter constraints. The performance of the model also suggests that this computational substructure may be relevant within the dendritic trees of CNS neurons in general.},

 abstract     = {This report describes Processor Coupling, a mechanism for controlling multiple ALUs on a single integrated circuit to exploit both instruction-level and inter-thread parallelism. A compiler statically schedules individual threads to discover available intra-thread instruction-level parallelism. The runtime scheduling mechanism interleaves threads, exploiting inter-thread parallelism to maintain high ALU utilization. ALUs are assigned to threads on a cycle byscycle basis, and several threads can be active concurrently. Simulation results show that Processor Coupling performs well both on single threaded and multi-threaded applications. The experiments address the effects of memory latencies, function unit latencies, and communication bandwidth between function units.},

 abstract     = {Recognizing standard computational structures (cliches) in a program can help an experienced programmer understand the program. We develop a graph parsing approach to automating program recognition in which programs and cliches are represented in an attributed graph grammar formalism and recognition is achieved by graph parsing. In studying this approach, we evaluate our representation's ability to suppress many common forms of variation which hinder recognition. We investigate the expressiveness of our graph grammar formalism for capturing programming cliches. We empirically and analytically study the computational cost of our recognition approach with respect to two medium-sized, real-world simulator programs.},

 abstract     = {In my research, I have performed an extensive experimental investigation of harmonic-drive properties such as stiffness, friction, and kinematic error. From my experimental results, I have found that these properties can be sharply non-linear and highly dependent on operating conditions. Due to the complex interaction of these poorly behaved transmission properties, dynamic response measurements showed surprisingly agitated behavior, especially around system resonance. Theoretical models developed to mimic the observed response illustrated that non-linear frictional effects cannot be ignored in any accurate harmonic-drive representation. Additionally, if behavior around system resonance must be replicated, kinematic error and transmission compliance as well as frictional dissipation from gear- tooth rubbing must all be incorporated into the model.},

A theoretical background is presented along with some insight into the methdos of calculating multiple mode sequences. The Middeck Active Control Experiment (MACE) is then described as the testbed for hardware experiments. These results are shown and some of the difficulties of dealing with nonlinearities are discussed. The paper is concluded with some conclusions about calculating and implementing impulse shaping in complex nonlinear systems.},
