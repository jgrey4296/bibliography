This paper demonstrates a clause combining relation that is also found as part of larger text structures, and shows how this fact can be used to explain cases in which contrastive clause combining appears between clauses that are not in fact in contrast. The appropriate generalization is that the relations of clause combining and the relations of general text structure are the same. Use of this generalization should make AI text planning and text generation significantly easier.},

It is shown how the design task can be broken down into a number of very explicit demands on the environment. In the main part of the report, the results of application of such an approach is sketched, with particular emphasis on the general organization of the knowledge base and the discourse model parts of the environment.},

 abstract     = {approx. 55 pages .sp sp SYSTEMIC GRAMMAR AND FUNCTIONAL UNIFICATION GRAMMAR: Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) and Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) are superficially very different approaches to grammatical knowledge, but they share an underlying comparability that runs very deep. FUG shares with systemic descriptions an emphasis on the functions of linguistic objects, and an explicit representation of feature choices. This paper explores how a systemic grammar can be represented in FUG notation, as a step toward creating a grammatical analysis program for English. Because FUG has been developed as a computational tool, expressing a systemic grammar in FUG notation allows new computational techniques to be applied to it. Among other benefits, this program will make it possible to study how much the grammatical functions of sentences are recoverable from them. It will also provide a method to test the amount of ambiguity implicit in a systemic description, a topic which has so far been inaccessible. This use of FUG as an alternate representation for SFG may have some additional benefits for both frameworks. It provides some solutions to problems in systemic notation which are described by Matthiessen (in this volume). Several extensions to the FUG framework are also suggested by this study. .sp sp REPRESENTATIONAL ISSUES IN SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR: Nigel is a large diverse computational grammar for text generation. Its framework is an implementation of Systemic Functional Theory of grammar and it constitutes a context in which the representation of systemic theory can be explored and studied. .sp sp This paper surveys the representational devices used in the Nigel grammar and the representational issues that they raise in relation to systemic theory. These issues are diagnosed in the light of the metafunctional differentiation of systemic theory.},
