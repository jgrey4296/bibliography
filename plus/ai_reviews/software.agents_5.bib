 abstract     = {This paper argues that the mobile agent approach is well suited for sporadic communication in open distributed systems - especially for rather ?loose? coope-rations across local and organizational boundaries: In an increasing number of cases, management of distributed business procedures reaches beyond such boundaries. This means for most existing workflow manage-ment systems that cooperating partners are required to give up their local autonomy. However, for cases in which business partners intend to cooper-ate but still need to preserve their local autonomy, process participation on the basis of mobile agents represents an appropriate mechanism. This article shows how such process integration can be achieved. It also demonstrates how the COSM (Common Open Service Market) system soft-ware can be extended in order to use petri-net based process definitions which realize mobile agents in an integrated distributed system platform.},

 abstract     = {Based on the notion of persistent threads in Tycoon, we investigate thread migration as a programming construct for building activity-oriented distributed applications. We first show how a straight-forward extension of a higher-order persistent language can be used to define activities that span multiple (semi-) autonomous nodes in heterogeneous networks. In particular, we discuss the intricate binding issues that arise in systems where threads are first-class language citizens that may access local and remote, mobile and immobile resources.
 We also describe how our system model can be understood as a promising generalization of the more static architecture of first-order and higher-order distributed object systems. Finally, we give some insight into the implementation of persistent and migrating threads and we explain how to represent bindings to ubiquitous resources present at each node visited by a migrating thread on the network to avoid excessive communication or storage costs.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are autonomous objects that can migrate from node to node of a computer network. Mobile agent technology has been proposed for various application areas, including electronic commerce, systems management and active messaging. Many of these applications - especially those for electronic commerce - require agents to be performed {\textquotedblleft}exactly once{\textquotedblright}, independent of communication and node failures. In other words, once a mobile agent has been launched, it must never be lost before its execution is finished. Moreover, each {\textquotedblleft}portion{\textquotedblright} of the agent performed at the visited nodes is performed exactly once. Due to the autonomy of mobile agents, there is no {\textquotedblleft}natural{\textquotedblright} instance that monitors the progress of an agent's execution. As a result of that agents may be blocked due to node crashes or network partitioning even if there are other nodes available that could continue processing. In this paper, we will describe a protocol that ensures the exactly once property of agents and additionally reduces the blocking probability of agents by introducing so-called observer nodes for monitoring the progress of agents. This protocol is based on conventional transactional technology, such as defined by X/Open DTP or CORBA OTS. It is implemented in the Mole, a mobile agent system developed at Stuttgart University.},

 abstract     = {Orphan detection and termination in distributed systems is a well researched field for which many solutions exist. These solutions exploit well defined parent-child relationships given in distributed systems. But they are not applicable in mobile agent systems, since no similar natural relationship between agents exist. Thus new protocols have to be developed. In this paper one such protocol for orphan detection and agent termination is presented. First we present two approaches, the energy concept and the path concept. The energy concept is a passive termination protocol, and the path concept is a protocol for finding agents, that can be used to implement active termination. The `energy' approach is based on the idea that an agent is provided with a limited amount of energy, which can be spent in exchange for the resources used by the agent. From time to time the agent has to request additional energy from its creator. The agent is terminated as soon as the energy falls to 0. This approach to agent termination implicitly implements orphan detection, i.e. if the creator has terminated, the dependent agents are killed as soon as they have no energy left. The `path' approach uses a chain of proxies. As soon as an agent leaves a location, a proxy is created that points to the new location. By following the chain of proxies, the path, one can find any agent, and consequently terminate it. Both approaches have disadvantages. By merging them on different levels we create a protocol that combines the advantages of both approaches, and at the same time minimizes the disadvantages. The `shadow' approach uses the idea of a placeholder (shadow) which is assigned by the agent system to each new agent. The shadow records the location of all dependent agents. Removing the root shadow implies that all dependent shadows and agents are terminated recursively. We demonstrate that the shadow approach can be used for termination of groups of agents even if the exact location of each single agent is not known. We show that shadow protocol is less fault-sensitive than the path approach and needs less communication cost than the energy approach},

Logs of user accesses to a site provide an opportunity to observe users interacting with that site and make improvements to the site's structure and presentation. We propose adaptive sites: web sites that improve themselves by learning from user access patterns. Adaptive webs can make popular pages more accessible, highlight interesting links, connect related pages, and cluster similar documents together. An adaptive web can perform these self-improvements autonomously or advise a site's webmaster, summarizing access information and making suggestions. In this paper we define adaptive web sites, explain and formalize several kinds of improvements that an adaptive site can make, and give examples of applying these improvements to existing sites.},

For this to be possible, the untrusted code producer must supply with the code a safety proof that attests to the code's adherence to a previously defined safety policy. The host can then easily and quickly validate the proof without using cryptography and without consulting any external agents. In order to gain preliminary experience with PCC, we have performed several case studies. We show in this paper how proof-carrying code might be used to develop safe assembly-language extensions of ML programs. In the context of this case study, we present and prove the adequacy of concrete representations for the safety policy, the safety proofs, and the proof validation. Fi- nally, we briefly discuss how we use proof-carrying code to develop network packet filters that are faster than similar filters developed using other techniques and are formally guaranteed to be safe with respect to a given operating system safety policy.},

The global sharing of information, the operation on multiple platforms in heterogeneous networks, and the lucrative signs of electronic commerce force application developers to make their applications work in a distributed client-server environment, dealing with incompatible hardware architectures and operating systems. This paper introduces Travelling Objects (TOs), a new paradigm in distributed object computing, based on an enhanced object model and built upon the platform-independent and dynamic programming language Java. Additionally, the authors provide an insight how the Travelling Object Runtime System (TORS) allows to send, receive, and interact with TOs. Finally, an easy-to-use TO Generator is introduced that produces TOs out of arbitrary Java applications.},

However, gathering information and using services distributed in networks requires knowing exactly what kinds of information and services are required for a task, where they are, and how they can be obtained or utilized. Tracking down the answers to these questions can be difficult, time-consuming tasks. Mobile agent technology is expected to free users from these tasks. Instead of the user searching, 'intelligent' mobile agents will comprehend the users requirements, search network nodes autonomously for appropriate information and services, and return with the answers. We developed a model based on the ability of agents to make flexible plans. The Plangent system enables mobile agents to make a plan based on user input and adopt it accordingly to information gathered from the network. In this article, we describe how we combined planning functions with mobile agent facilities, and show how the agents behave intelligently in an example application of personal travel assistance.},

Code mobility, for instance, allows for invocation-time binding between a code fragment and the location where it executes. Similarly, mobile computing allows hosts (and the software they execute) to alter their physical location. Despite apparent similarities, the two paradigms are distinct in their treatment of location and movement. This paper seeks to uncover a common foundation for the two paradigms by exploring the manner in which stereotypical forms of code mobility can be expressed in a programming notation developed for mobile computing.

We present infrastructural support for mobility and network monitoring and show how adaptalk, a Java-based mobile Internet chat application can take advantage of this support to dynamically place the chat server so as to minimize response time. Our conclusion was that on-line network monitoring and adaptive placement of shared data-structures can significantly improve performance of distributed applications on the Internet.},

 abstract     = {Some of the most diffcult questions to answer when designing a distributed application are related to mobility: what information to transfer between sites and when and how to transfer it. Transparent distribution, the property that a program's behavior is independent of how it is partitioned among sites, does not directly address these questions. Therefore we propose to extend the language semantics with mobility control. the ability for objects to migrate between sites or to remain stationary at one site. In this way, the syntax and semantics of objects are the same regardless of whether they are used as stationary servers, mobile agents, or simply as caches. We show how to give objects an arbitrary mobility behavior that is independent of the object's definition. This gives the programmer a simple and effective control both over information transfer and over the resulting network communication patterns. These ideas have been implemented in Distributed Oz, a concurrent object-oriented language which is state-aware and has dataflow synchronization. Distributed Oz is an extension to the publicly*-available Oz 2.0 system.},

Two interaction models, namely the remote procedure call and the agent migration are considered. Performance models for a single interaction are introduced, which are then used to derive a performance model for a sequence of interactions. This performance model can be used to evaluate the performance of any possible behaviour of an agent in a given scenario. The application of the performance model for a typical scenario in mobile computing shows that the optimal behaviour of an agent is achieved by a mixed sequence of remote procedure calls and agent migrations. The performance model is validated by measurements of interactions of real agents in the mobile agent system Mole.},

Code-exchange, on the other hand, means that coordination is achieved by sending around code fragments which alter the data that is bound to the network's hosts. Actual systems usually pick and combine several techniques that are positioned at different places in this spectrum. Sun's JAVA and the corresponding code-on-demand approach, for example, would be closer to the data-exchange viewpoint, while Stamos' and Gifford's Remote Evaluation is more in the line of mobile code because the initiator has more instructional capabilities. Mobile software agent systems are quite close to pure code-exchange, although they often mix-in classical data-exchange techniques (data streams between agents, or mailboxes). The aim of the mobile code environment M (m-zero) is to be as faithful as possible to the code-exchange point of view.},

 abstract     = {The rapid growth of computer networks has created an opportunity for developing massively distributed computer systems. Such systems will likely consist of loose communities of heterogeneous machines running different operating systems with different security policies. The challenge is to design a reliable, and yet efficient, infrastructure trustworthy enough for electronic commerce and flexible enough to allow software upgrades as well as new functionality to propagate in a decentralized, inherently insecure, wide area network. Mobile object systems embody a paradigm where computations, i.e. running programs, may move across the network and carry out truly distributed computations. The vision is that computations structured as autonomous systems of objects will roam the network performing complex tasks on the behalf of their human owner. These mobile systems of objects carry their data as well as their code with them during their journey; thus allowing almost unlimited extendability. Such unfettered mobility raises justified security concerns. From the host's stand point first. Can an arbitrary code fragment be entrusted with local resources? To what degree is it possible to control the behaviour of downloaded code? How can secrecy and integrity be preserved? From the sender's stand point next. Is it possible to entrust the network with mobile computations that encode valuable knowledge and are empowered to carry out commercial transactions? Even though it is technically feasible to charge foreign computations for small service such as execution time or storage. The key question whether there is a way to achieve a sufficient level of security for this approach to be viable? Currently, we must answer by the negative. None of the existing mobile computation systems meet the security requirements of electronic commerce. Lack of security fosters a just say no attitude towards mobile computations in portions of the scientific and business community. The proverbial ball is now in the camp of mobile computations research. It is up to us to demonstrate that mobile objects may meet the stringent security criteria of real world applications. The main contribution of this chapter is the study of security threats inherent to communication in mobile object systems. We will study how mobile object systems communicate. Describe the dangers of traditional communication mechanisms and outline two research directions currently being investigated.},

This class consists of all entities that can be fully described by the specification of the set of interfaces supported by the object and the semantics of the operations in those interfaces. The class includes objects that share a single address space, objects that are in separate address spaces on the same machine, and objects that are in separate address spaces on different machines (with, perhaps, different architectures). On the view that all objects are essentially the same kind of entity, these differences in relative location are merely an aspect of the implementation of the object. Indeed, the location of an object may change over time, as an object migrates from one machine to another or the implementation of the object changes. It is the thesis of this note that this unified view of objects is mistaken. There are fundamental differences between the interactions of distributed objects and the interactions of non-distributed objects. Further, work in distributed object-oriented systems that is based on a model that ignores or denies these differences is doomed to failure, and could easily lead to an industry-wide rejection of the notion of distributed object-based systems.},

 abstract     = {Research papers available on the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) are often poorly organized, often exist in forms opaque to search engines (e.g. Postscript), and increase in quantity daily. Significant amounts of time and effort are typically needed in order to find interesting and relevant publications on the Web. We have developed a Web based information agent that assists the user in the process of performing a scientific literature search. Given a set of keywords, the agent uses Web search engines and heuristics to locate and download papers. The papers are parsed in order to extract information features such as the abstract and individually identified citations. The agent's Web interface can be used to find relevant papers in the database using keyword searches, or by navigating the links between papers formed by the citations. Links to both {\textquotedblleft}citing{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}cited{\textquotedblright} publications can be followed. In addition to simple browsing and keyword searches, the agent can find papers which are similar to a given paper using word information and by analyzing common citations made by the papers.},

The New Millennium Remote Agent (NMRA) includes a planner-scheduler that produces plans, and an executive that carries them out. In this paper we discuss several issues arising at the interface between planning and execution. Issues include execution latency, plan dispatchability, and the distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events. Temporal information in the plan is represented within the general framework of Simple Temporal Constraint networks, as introduced by Dechter, Meiri, and Pearl. However, the execution requirements have a substantial impact on the topology of the links and the propagation through the network.},

 abstract     = {The New Millennium Remote Agent (NMRA) will be the first AI system to control an actual spacecraft. The spacecraft domain places a strong premium on autonomy and requires dynamic recoveries and robust concurrent execution, all in the presence of tight real-time deadlines, changing goals, scarce resource constraints, and a wide variety of possible failures. To achieve this level of execution robustness, we have integrated a procedural executive based on generic procedures with a deductive model-based executive. A procedural executive provides sophisticated control constructs such as loops, parallel activity, locks, and synchronization which are used for robust schedule execution, hierarchical task decomposition, and routine configuration management. A deductive executive provides algorithms for sophisticated state inference and optimal failure recovery planning. The integrated executive enables designers to code knowledge via a combination of procedures and declarative models, yielding a rich modeling capability suitable to the challenges of real spacecraft control. The interface between the two executives ensures both that recovery sequences are smoothly merged into high-level schedule execution and that a high degree of reactivity is retained to effectively handle additional failures during recovery.},

 abstract     = {Partial failures and network outages are handled well by two-stage commit transaction protocols. This should have important applications for distributed processing. But the size and complexity of transaction processing systems tends to limit their use. In contrast with most other transaction processing systems, AXTP is small and easy to use. It is a component-based system, written using Java Beans, and can be configured to a wide range of requirements. AXTP is built on top of UDP/IP, rather than TCP. This has a number of advantages: 1. Connection management is eliminaged - only a single socket is needed, 2. TCP-specific restrictions relating to broadband, satellite, and cellular phones no longer apply, and 3. Number of packets needed for a minimum transaction is only 4, while TCP requires 7 just to open a connection. AXTP uses XML for its wire protocol, and employes decaying retry timers to greatly simplify recovery from communication failures. Another interesting characteristic of AXTP is that the client is untrusted. All activity relating to a single transaction must pass through a single server. Transactions must be of an approved duration and are aborted by the server when the time limit is exceeded. (For multi-tier transactions, only the top-level server may abort a transaction.)},

 abstract     = {This paper explores the process of representing and classifying conflicts in agent-based systems. These capabilities form the basis for an in-progress implementation of a domain-independent conflict management framework for multi-agent environments. The following hypothesis is to be tested under this implementation: the most appropriate conflict resolution strategy for a given conflict is contingent on the type of conflict, the agents' organizational role, and the agents' solution preferences. A three layered representation of conflict is employed (i.e. goal, plan, belief). The representation serves to trace the source(s) of conflict and provides a map to potential resolutions. Each layer of the representation is assigned an associated conflict type reflecting the source of the conflict (i.e. what must be changed to eliminate the conflict: goals, plans, or beliefs). A formal definition of these three conflict classes is provided. The ongoing implementation of these concepts through the Sensible Agent testbed is discussed.},

Sensible agents are agents that operate in a multi-agent based system with the ability to dynamically adapt their level of autonomy. Conflicts are classified as goal, plan and belief conflicts. It is shown that such a classification is useful in developing effective conflict detection and resolution mechanisms. The conflict classification and detection algorithm developed in this paper is used in the conflict resolution module - the Conflict Resolution Advisor, of Sensible Agents. An example illustrates the application of this scheme to a simple shop floor routing example},

 abstract     = {Mole is one of the first Java-based mobile agent systems. It runs on an unmodified Java virtual machine on PCs under Windows 95/NT and on Workstations under several UNIX dialects. Earlier versions of Mole have provided a basic infrastructure for communication and migration of mobile agents. Version of Mole has been strongly revised and several requests and proposals from users of the earlier ver sions of Mole were integrated into the new release. In particular Mole supports communication between agent groups and concept of sessions. The infrastructure of Mole includes a resource manager, a direc tory service and a global naming scheme for agents. In order to support the design of agents, a graphical agent monitor allows to visualize the system behaviour as a whole or of a single agent in particular. Mole further provides a thread management unit to overcome some shortcomings of the Java virtual machine. Mole provides a simple means for installation and configuration of the system. This paper describes the architecture and infrastructure provided by Version 3.0 of Mole.},
