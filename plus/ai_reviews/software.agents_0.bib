Task distribution is affected by a negotiation process, a discussion carried on between nodes with tasks to be executed and nodes that may be able to execute those tasks. We present the specification of the protocol and demonstrate its use in the solution of a problem in distributed sensing. The utility of negotiation as an interaction mechanism is discussed. It can be used to achieve different goals, such as distributing control and data to avoid bottlenecks and enabling a finer degree of control in making resource allocation and focus decisions than is possible with traditional mechanisms.},

We also discuss considerations relevant to large-scale parallelism in the context of {\i}t open systems, and define an abstract model which establishes the equivalence of systems defined by actor programs.},

 abstract     = {A new technique for computer-to-computer communication is presented that can increase the generality and performance of distributed systems. This technique, called Remote Evaluation, lets one computer send another computer a request in the form of a program. A computer that receives such a request executes the program in the request and returns the results to the sending computer. Remote evaluation provides a new degree of flexibility in the design of distributed systems. In present distributed systems that use Remote Procedure Calls, server computers are designed to offer a fixed set of services. In a system that uses remote evaluation, server computers are more properly viewed as programmable soft abstractions. One consequence of this flexibility is that remote evaluation can reduce the amount of communication that is required to accomplish a given task. Our thesis is that it is possible to design a remote evaluation system that permits the processing of a program to be distributed among remote computers without changing the program's semantics. In support of this thesis our proposal for remote evaluation uses the same argument passing semantics for local and remote procedure invocations (call by sharing); it provides atomic transactions to mask computer and communication failures; and it provides a static checking framework that identifies procedures that can not be relocated from computer to computer. We discuss both the semantics of remote evaluation and our experience with a prototype implementation. The idea of a remote data type is introduced to let one computer name objects at a remote computer. A detailed discussion of the compile-time and run-time support necessary for remote evaluation is provided, along with a detailed sample application.},

 tags         = {__untagged},
 abstract     = {This thesis describes a theoretical framework for modelling cooperative dialogue. The linguistic theory is a version of speech act theory adopted from Cohen and Levesque, in which dialogue utterances are generated and interpreted pragmatically in the context of a theory of rational interaction. The latter is expressed as explicitly and formally represented principles of rational agenthood and cooperative interaction. The focus is the development of strategic principles of multi-agent interaction as such a basis for cooperative dialogue. In contrast to the majority of existing work, these acknowledge the positive role of conflict to multi-agent cooperation, and make no assumptions regarding the benevolence and sincerity of agents. The result is a framework wherein agents can resolve conflicts by negotiation. It is a preliminary stage to the future building of computer models of cooperative dialogue for both HCI and DAI, which will therefore be more widely and generally applicable than those currently in existence. The theory of conflict and cooperation is expressed in the different patterns of mental states which characterize multi-agent conflict, cooperation and indifference as three alternative postural relations. Agents can recognize and potentially create these. Dialogue actions are the strategic tools with which mental states can be manipulated, whilst acknowledging that agents are autonomous over their mental states; they have control over what they acquire and reveal in dialogue. Strategic principles of belief and goal adoption are described in terms of the relationships between autonomous agents' beliefs, goals, preferences, and interests, and the relation of these to action. Veracity, mendacity, concealing and revealing are defined as properties of acts. The role of all these elements in reasoning about dialogue action and conflict resolution, is testea in analyses of two example dialogues; a record of a real trade union negotiation and an extract from {\textquotedblleft}Othello{\textquotedblright} by Shakespeare.},

An explicit goal of Emerald is support for object mobility; objects in Emerald can freely move within the system to take advantage of distribution and dynamically changing environments. We say that Emerald has fine-grained mobility because Emerald objects can be small data objects as well as process objects. Fine-grained mobility allows us to apply mobility in new ways but presents implementation problems as well. This paper discusses the benefits of fine-grained mobility, the Emerald language and run-time mechanisms that support mobility, and techniques for implementing mobility that do not degrade the performance of local operations. Performance measurements of the current implementation are included.},

It is indicated how AI techniques differ from conventional programming techniques and how they extend far beyond those provided by so-called expert systems. Some of the major areas of AI, including natural language understanding, problem solving, and computer vision, are then discussed. It is shown how industry can utilize these technologies by considering some recent work in three areas: real-time control of NASA's space shuttle, reasoning among multiple systems, and just-in-time scheduling. Finally, some of the outstanding problems in AI are described.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes research concerned with automating the monitoring and control of spacecraft systems. In particular, the paper examines the application of SRI's Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) to the handling of malfunctions in the Reaction Control System (RCS) of NASA's space shuttle. Unlike traditional monitoring and control systems, PRS is able to reason about and perform complex tasks in a very flexible and robust manner, somewhat in the manner of a human assistant. Using various RCS malfunctions as examples (including sensor faults, leaking components, multiple alarms, and regulator and jet failures), it is shown how PRS manages to combine both goal-directed reasoning and the ability to react rapidly to unanticipated changes in its environment. In conclusion, some important issues in the design of PRS are reviewed and future enhancements are indicated.},

 abstract     = {Reasoning about the beliefs of an agent has played an important role in Philosophy, Logic, and Artificial Intelligence. A great deal of effort has been spent on analyzing and formalizing the static aspects of belief systems. Although the dynamic aspects of belief systems, or aspects relating to how beliefs change with time, has been recognised as being important, detailed work describing the dynamic aspects of belief systems has started emerging only recently. This report examines the dynamic aspects of belief systems, also called belief revision, from a philosophical, logical, and AI perspective. It discusses two philosophical theories of belief revision, namely the coherence and foundational theories. Unlike most philosophical works which treat these as two opposing theories, we view the foundational theory as an extension of the coherence theory of belief revision. Coherence theory is based on the intuitive principles of minimal change and maximal coherence, whereas foundational theory is based on the above two principles together with the foundational thesis, which states that all beliefs are justified beliefs. By providing a possible-worlds semantics, axiomatization, and soundness and completeness results for both the theories, the report presents a detailed and formal account of belief revision that has been lacking in most earlier work in this area. This formal theory is then used to reason about actions. The resulting theory provides an elegant solution to some of the important philosophical problems in AI, namely the conceptual frame and ramification problems. It also facilitates reasoning in dynamic situations where the world changes during the execution of an action. The principles of minimal change and maximal coherence seem to unify belief revision and reasoning about actions and may form a fundamental core for reasoning about other dynamic processes that involve change.},

We present a formal definition of what it could mean for a group to jointly commit to a common goal, and explore how these joint commitments relate to the individual commitments of the team members. We then consider the case of joint intention, where the goal in question involves the team performing some action. In both cases, the theory is formulated in a logical language of belief, action, and time previously used to characterize individual commitment and intention. An important consequence of the theory is the types of communication among the team members that it predicts will often be necessary.},

Action selection is modelled as an emergent property of an activation/inhibition dynamics among these modules. A concrete action selection algorithm is presented and a detailed account of the results is given. This algorithm combines characteristics of both traditional planners and reactive systems. It provides global parameters, which one can use to tune the action selection behavior along several criteria, such as goal orientedness versus situation orientedness, bias towards ongoing plans versus adaptivity, and sensitivity to goal conflicts and `thoughtfulness' versus speed.},

 abstract     = {Behaviour based decomposition of an autonomous robot into modules such as build-maps, explore, wander, avoid objects, is more useful than the classical decomposition which is perception, modelling, planning, task execution, motor control. An algorithm is described that allows a behaviour based robot to learn on the basis of positive and nagative feedback when to activate its behaviour s. In accordance with the philosophy of the behaviour based robots the algorithm is completely distributed. Each of the behaviours independently tries to find out :- 1. whether it is relevant (i.e. whether it is all correlated to a positive feedback.) 2. what the conditions are under which it maximises the probability of receiving the positive feedback and minimises the probability of receiving a negative feedback. The algorithm was tested on a 6 legged robot which had to learn how to co-ordinate its legs to walk forward. As the number of behaviours increase, the problem of control, co-ordination becomes increasingly complex. There is a complete distribution in the algorithm and there is no central learning component and each behaviour tries to learn when it should become active. The global search space for the robot with n behaviours and m binary perceptual conditions is $n*3^m$ as every behaviour has to learn an on,off and a don't care value for every perceptual condition. Relevance and reliability of a behaviour are also defined. Research is going on to make Genghis walk backward by adding a switch that inverts the movement feedback. Study of the properties of the algorithm by building a mathematical model of it is also a proposed research. - Mali 10/93},

 abstract     = {A new technique for computer-to-computer communications is presented that can increase the performance of distributed systems. This technique, called remote evaluation, lets one computer send another computer a request in the form of a program. A computer that receives such a request executes the program in the request and returns the results to the sending computer. Remote evaluation provides a new degree of flexibility in the design of distributed systems. In present distributed systems that use remote procedure calls, server computers are designed to offer a fixed set of services. In a system that uses remote evaluation, server computers are more properly viewed as programmable processors. One consequence of this flexibility is that remote evaluation can reduce the amount of communication that is required to accomplish a given task. In this paper we discuss the semantics of remote evaluation and its effect on distributed systems design. We also summarize our experience with a prototype implementation.},

As multiagent systems are various, we start with a classification of multiagent systems which is particularly influenced by an article from Decker, Durfee, and Lesser [Decker    89]. In the following, the aspects of communication, planning, and negotiation are examined. On the occasion of communication, the discussion is split into: no communication {\textendash} simple protocols {\textendash} artificial languages. The planning aspect is broken into sections: from classical to multiagent planning {\textendash} a general multiagent planning theory {\textendash} intention {\textendash} intention-directed multiagent planning. Finally, a summary of Brigitte and Hassan L\^aasri and Victor Lesser's negotiation theory will be presented.},
