The architecture produces behavior which is reliable, task-directed (and taskable), and reactive to contingencies. Experiments on real and simulated real-world robots are described. The architecture smoothly integrates planning and reacting by performing these two functions asynchronously using heterogeneous architectural elements, and using the results of planning to guide the robot's actions but not to control them directly. The architecture can thus be viewed as a concrete implementation of Agre and Chapman's plans-as-communications theory. The central result of this work is to show that completely unmodified classical AI programming methodologies using centralized world models can be usefully incorporated into real-world embedded reactive systems.},

 abstract     = {The development of systems capable of handling and diagnosing malfunctions in real time has long been of considerable practical importance. This paper describes the architecture of such a system, called the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS). PRS is based on the notion of a rational agent that can reason and plan under possibly stringent constraints on both time and information. This approach provides the system with the ability to reason in complex ways about dynamic processes, while still maintaining the reactivity required to ensure appropriate responsiveness and control. By considering two large-scale applications in aerospace and telecommunications, it is shown how PRS meets many of the critical requirements for real-time malfunction-handling and diagnostic systems. Finally, PRS is compared with a number of other real-time reasoning and knowledge-based architectures that have been used in similar applications.},

 abstract     = {Computers and data networks continue to get faster. However computers and networks are geting faster in different ways. This difference is best illustrated by an example. Consider the problem of making a car faster. A 100-times improvement in speed would imply cars with cruising speeds of about 600 miles per hour. Computers are getting faster like cars get faster; they perform more instructions per second. Now imagine giving the car more storage space, while keeping its maximum speed constant. A 100-times improvement yeilds a ca that can hold 100-tomes more luggage, but stilll only goes 60 miles per hour. Networks are getting faster like larger cars, they send more bitss per packet because the speed of limit limits how fast a packet can get from one place to another. This thesis examines the implcations of this difference for the future of distributed computing. The thesis identifies four major implication: itemize The performance difference is permanent.. The speed of light is constant and there is no hope of reducing the network delay. The time spent waiting for data to cross the network will soon become the largest part of most programs' run-time. A single exchange of packets will take far more time than executing all the application's instructions. Due to their differing latencies, LANs and WANs will probably continue to exhibit different performance characteristics for some time to come. Popular distributed computing paradigms such as RPC do not appear to scale well to an environment in which network delays are long. itemize The thesis also presents a novel paradigm for distributed computation call late-binding in which applications send arbitrary pieces of code to arbitrary remote systems for evaluation. It is argued that this paradigm can give optimal performance in the number of network transits required to complete a computation. A model of distributed computation is developed and used to show that optimizing network transits will usually be the determining factor for the performance of distributed applications. Finally, it is shown that implementing late-binding is feasible.},

This language allows for the description of control and communication management, a hierarchical representation of a DAI system at different levels of detail, and the simulation of its performance. The language is based on three different entities {\textendash} sequential actors, distributed actors and channel managers. A sequential actor describes a single DAI module (agent). A distributed actor represents a net of agents characterizing both a whole DAI system and its sub-parts. A channel manager administers channel communications among agents. This paper specifically illustrates (i) how data and procedural abstraction properties of such a language satisfy all the representation requirements for modelling DAI systems, and (ii) how message passing in an access-oriented paradigm can be an excellent basis for the representation of the mechanisms which drive the performance of a DAI system. We conclude with an example of the language application.},

After a detailed motivation, the role of speech acts as a basis for a communication architecture for cooperating agents will be discussed. Viewing them as actions the agents have to perform, the planning aspects will be elaborated. A formal model of communication will then be given which leads, together with the speech act planning, to the communication architecture.},

 abstract     = {One of the basic questions of research in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is how agents have to be structured and organized, and what functionalities they need in order to be able to act and to interact in a dynamic environment. To cope with this question is the purpose of models and architectures for autonomous and intelligent agents.In the first part of this report, InteRRaP, an agent architecture for multi-agent systems is presented. The basic idea is to combine the use of patterns of behaviour with planning facilities in order to be able to exploit the advantages both of the reactive, behaviour-based and of the deliberate, plan-based paradigm. Patterns of behaviour allow an agent to react flexibly to changes in its environment. What is considered necessary for the performance of more sophisticated tasks is the ability of devising plans deliberately. A further important feature of the model is that it explicitly represents knowledge and strategies for cooperation. This makes it suitable for describing high-level interaction among autonomous agents.In the second part of the report, the loading-dock domain is presented, which has been the first application the InteRRaP agent model has been tested with. An automated loading-dock is described where the agent society consists of forklifts which have to load and unload trucks in a shared, dynamic environment.},

Conventional commands, whether visual or textual, specify one particular action to perform. To carry out a complex task, such as reducing disk utilization, the user is forced to explicitly specify each of the necessary steps. Traditional command-language extension mechanisms, such as shell scripts and pipes, enable the user to aggregate and compose various commands, but force him or her to write and debug programs {\textendash} a formidable challenge for naive users. This paper presents a goal-oriented approach to the operating system command interface, realized through an implementation we call OS agents. Using OS agents, the user simply specifies a goal to accomplish, and the OS agent decides how to accomplish that goal using its knowledge base of the system state and its commands. The OS agent dynamically synthesizes the appropriate command sequence, issues the required commands and system calls, handles errors, and retries commands if necessary. With OS agents, we have applied AI planning and learning techniques to the operating system environment to increase the power of the user's commands.},

Results of a set of experiments are presented in which a small population of information filtering agents was evolved to make a personalized selection of news articles from the USENET newsgroups. The results show that the artificial evolution component of the system is responsible for improving the recall rate of the selected set of articles, while learning from feedback component improves the precision rate.},

 abstract     = {One way to provide fault isolation among cooperating software modules is to place each in its own address space. However, for tightly-coupled modules, this solution incurs prohibitive context switch overhead. In this paper, we present a software approach to implementing fault isolation within a single address space. Our approach has two parts. First, we load the code and data for a distrusted module into its own fault domain, a logically separate portion of the application's address space. Second, we modify the object code of a distrusted module to prevent it from writing or jumping to an address outside its fault domain. Both these software operations are portable and programming language independent. Our approach poses a tradeoff relative to hardware fault isolation: substantially faster communication between fault domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution time for distrusted modules. We demonstrate that for frequently communicating modules, implementing fault isolation in software rather than hardware can substantially improve end-to-end application performance.},

The initial implementation of AOP, Agent-0, is a simple language for specifying agent behaviour. KQML provides a standard language for inter-agent communication. Our integration (which we have called Agent-K) demonstrates that Agent-0 and KQML are highly compatible. Agent-K provides the possibility of inter-operable (or open) software agents, that can communicate via KQML and which are programmed using the AOP approach.},

Other writers have pointed out, however, that mobile agent introduce severe concerns for security. We consider the advantages offered by mobile agents and assess them against alternate methods of achieving the same function. We conclude that, while the individual advantages of agents do not represent an overwhelming motivation for their adoption, the creatoin of a pervasive agent framework facilitates a very large number of network services and applications.},

This leads to a notion of entropy for information resources which agents seek to reduce in some way. The process of reducing uncertainty in an information corpus translates into elementary operations such as pattern matching, correlation and association. The model suggests algorithms appropriate for monitoring redundancy in information retrieval applications. Examples of implementations will be presented.},

We built and tested an agent system that addresses the real-world problem of han-dling the activities involved in scheduling a visitor to our laboratory. The system employs both task-specific and user-centered agents, and communicates with users using both email and a graphicalinterface. This experiment has helped us to identify crucial requirements in the successful deployment of software agents, including issues of reliability, security, and ease of use. The architecture we de-veloped to meet these requirements is flexible and extensible, and is guiding our current research on principles of agent design.},

 abstract     = {As network information resources grow in size, it is often most efficient to process queries and updates at the site where the data is located. This processing can be accomplished by using a traditional client-server network interface, which constrains the client to the set of queries supported by the server, or requires the server to send all data to the client for processing. The former is inflexible; the latter is inefficient. Transportable agents, which support the movement of the client computation to the location of the remote resource, have the potential to be more flexible and more efficient. Transportable agents are capable of suspending their execution, transporting themselves to another host on a network, and resuming execution from the point at which they were suspended. Transportable agents consume fewer network resources and can support systems that do not have permanent network connections, such as mobile computers and personal digital assistants. We describe a prototype transportable-agent implementation that facilitates research in this area. Agents are written in a script language that supports agent relocation, and the language is processed at each host by an agent interpreter. Electronic mail is the current transport mechanism and we plan to explore others. We present a technical-report searching agent as a demonstration of the capabilities of our prototype implementation.},

 abstract     = {Interface agents are semi-intelligent systems which assist users with daily computer-based tasks. Recently, various researchers have proposed a learning approach towards building such agents and some working prototypes have been demonstrated. Such agents learn by `watching over the shoulder' of the user and detecting patterns and regularities in the user's behavior. Despite the successes booked, a major problem with the learning approach is that the agent has to learn from scratch and thus takes some time becoming useful. Secondly, the agent's competence is necessarily limited to actions it has seen the user perform. Collaboration between agents assisting different users can alleviate both of these problems. We present a framework for multi-agent collaboration and discuss results of a working prototype, based on learning agents for electronic mail.},

Interface agents are computer programs that employ Artificial Intelligence techniques to provide active assistance to a user with computer-based tasks. Agents radically change the current user experience, through the metaphor that an agent can act as a personal assistant. The agent acquires its competence by learning from the user as well as from agents assisting other users. Several prototype agents have been built using this technique, including agents that provide personalized assistance with meeting scheduling, electronic mail handling, electronic news filtering and selection of entertainment.},
