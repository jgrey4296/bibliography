 abstract     = {This paper describes Coach, an evolutionary simulator developed to investigate strategies for teams in a competitive environment, and discusses some of the issues surrounding the evolution of cooperation among team members. As its title suggests, Coach is a simulator of sporting environments, as these possess the required motivations for such behaviour and have the potential to benefit the real sporting world. In addition to describing Coach, this paper describes two applications illustrating the potential and value of the system. It examines cooperation within a simplified model of the game of volleyball in which cooperation emerged in the form of players passing the ball between them in order to control it for an effective offensive hit. Each player learnt a specialized skill which, in close harmony with the other team member's skills, provided the team with a strategy not unlike those used by real volleyball players. Some preliminary experiments were also carried out to investigate communication among team members.},

This gives rise to a re{\textendash}interpretation of Agent Oriented Programming paradigm. We postulate that k{\textendash}b protocol (commitment statements in AOP terms) should be rational (i.e. maximizing the utility) and fixed, whereas the subject of change should be agent's utility and knowledge.

The multi-agent framework we have been investigating and developing, called the Cooperation Services Framework (CSF), is designed to support distributed computer-supported cooperative work in inter-organizational project management. This position paper reviews our developments to date, describes our programme for realising a prototype demonstrator, and discusses some of the issues to be addressed in future investigation and experimentation. In particular, extending the CSF to include `agent brokering' between `rational agents' would enable other applications for inter-organizational interactions to be developed, such as trading systems and on-line information services.},

The agent's ability for balancing these factors is very important in the multi-agents world as well as that for balancing deliberation and execution cost in the dynamic world. To realize this ability, we introduce two behavioral parameters, namely, the projection level and the commitment level. One controls how far the agent should project in his future based on his current state at the beginning of the planning. The other controls how far the agent should adhere to his plan when he detects change in the world. We show that the agent can control his time cost of planning and communication by changing these levels and, as the result of this, he can make a good plan on that occasion as well as adapt to changes in the world.},

 abstract     = {Over the past few years, several different approaches have been proposed to deal with Multi-Agent Autoepistemic reasoning. Most of them have some anomalous results while the rest do not have clear and constructive proof theory. For example, Parikh [91] only allows an agent to reason nonmonotonically about other agents' knowledge but not about other agents' nonmonotonic reasoning. Morgenstern [90] provides a limited way to deal with the problem but unfortunately it is not constructive. Although Halpern [94] develops an algorithmetic definition of multiagent nonmonotonic reasoning, his approach cannot deal with default reasoning even for single-agent case. It also does not allow nested nonmonotonic reasoning of an agent about other agents' nonmonotonic reasoning. More important perhaps, these approaches seem to have unintuitive results for multi-agent case and we shall show that by considering some examples from Speech Acts. Our purpose is to find out a simple yet generalised constructive proof-theoretic framework for Multi-Agent Autoepistemic reasoning which retains the advantages of existing approaches but does not have those peculiar results. Surprisingly, the new proof-theoretic framework can be obtained by a simple modification to Parikh's approach. Furthermore, the results show that our framework is not only generalise Morgenstern's and the others approaches but also Niemela's Constructive Tightly Grounded Autoepistemic Logic.},

A technical approach is proposed for specifying and analyzing cooperation and conflict resolution protocols among distributed agents. The plan of a single agent, the communication strategy between partners and the actual moves of entities are represented whithin a single framework. The proposed technique relies on modeling agent behaviours and coordinating algorithms by labeled Predicate/Transition Petri nets. Communication primitives are introduced for negotiating shared ressources among distinct partners. In particular, the localization of agents is taken into account for allowing either rendez-vous and simultaneous data exchange, or asynchronous exchanges via message passing. A formal description of distributed agreement protocols allows the verification of general properties such as deadlock avoidance and guarantee of progress. The introduced model leads to consider conflict and cooperation as two dual operations which have to be embedded into a negotiation protocol for conflict solving. Two-partie and multi-partie negotiation protocols are described.},

 abstract     = {In Multi-Agent systems, prediction of future states of observed events in an open and distributed environment gains importance with the growing complexity of the events agents have to deal with. We develop a model for applying Linear Prediction to a Multi-Agent environment. We design a prediction mechanism which senses its environment just by observing plain sampled data. No complex model of the environment has to be built in order to do good predictions of future events. Thus, our agents can react in a real time manner by simply analyzing the observed events. After introducing the theoretical background of Linear Prediction, we show that Linear Prediction can give good results even for multiple step predictions over a wide range of dynamics. Further, we show that, if agents apply our model competitively in a heterogeneous society of multiple agents, the stability and the performance of the whole system improves.},

This is based on cooperating intelligent entities in the sub-domains which make decisions through negotiation, using domain- specific knowledge both distributed among the entities and accessible to them. Using this architectural framework, an Agent Based Concurrent Design Environment system has been developed for feature-based design, manufacturability evaluation, and dynamic process planning. This is a multi-agent prototype system involving the following types of agent: design agent; geometric interface agent; feature agent; part agent; machine agent; tool agent; environment manager; and shop floor manager. A new technique for evaluating manufacturability is introduced, based on interacting intelligent features of the part being designed. This proof-of-concept system was developed for three-dimensional prismatic parts, with twenty-five different feature types, but can be extended to other geometries. The system has been completed and tested, and is being integrated into a larger multi-agent environment incorporating routing, scheduling, and overall production control.},

Lack of knowledge is modelled by means of games with incomplete information. Interactions among agents are both cooperative and noncooperative and are based on the rationality of the agents, which pick one of the equilibrium points of the game. Therefore the problem of equilibrium selection for noncooperative games is explored. For cooperative games the bargaining solution is used. Some examples of the traffic signal control domain which map interactions in noncooperative as well as in cooperative situations are presented.},

The structuring of this problem leads to a space of design tasks with a default order defined by the problem domain. Any one of these tasks can be the current task of the designer and is subject to influence from a case. The case is decomposed to extract a sequence of tasks to aid the designer in solving the current task, as well as geometric and relational information about the objects which make up the case. Each of these tasks in the case is instantiated into a computational agent, with a behavioral and a domain knowledge component. The behavioral component consists of a set of generic spatial actions, organised in layers. The domain component consists of knowledge needs for the layout of supply-air pipes. A generic control system is defined both for the interaction between the behavioral and domain component of the agent, as well as interaction between groups of agents. An interactive application of the designer, information from the case and agents then drives the problem to an intended solution. A scenario is sketched to give an idea of the case adaptation system in action.},

We give intuitive ideas concerning the architecture of multi-agent systems where this phenomenon may occur. We propose that agents able to migrate must interpret a universal meta-language that can express in a formal way the syntax and semantics of the languages for protocol description and execution used in the target societies. We also propose that the arriving agents must have access to some minimum meta-protocols allowing them to perform minimal interactions leading to the learning of the protocols used in each society.

We show that the COMINT model of decision making [3] enables us to approach rationalization in a rather natural fashion. Namely, it presents an automatic (as opposed to deliberative and thoughtful) way of selecting the convenient sets of knowledge structures to rationalize the agent's decisions. This automatic mechanism relies on the concepts of activation and association, both of which are central to the model of memory [2] underlying COMINT. We also give a formal definition of a rationalization basis and show how it is generated. Along the paper, we discuss some examples of personnel selection in organizations. Some aspects of the implementation of the model are also presented. Although rationalization serves a lot of purposes, this paper emphasizes its role in a multi-agent society.},

In this work, interaction among agents is represented as a repeated two-player game, where an agents' objective is to look for a strategy that maximizes their expected sum of rewards in the game. We assume that agents' strategies can be modeled as finite automata. A model based reasoning approach is presented as a possible method for learning an efficient interactive strategy. First, we describe how an agent should find an optimal strategy against a given model. Second, we present a heuristic algorithm that infers a model of the opponent's automata from its input/output behavior. A set of experiments that show the potential merit of the algorithm is reported as well.},

Some of the basic ingredients of such notions are identified and some steps are made towards their definition. In particular, it is claimed that a notion of Commitment is needed as a mediation between the individual and the collective one. Before constructing a notion of ''Collective or Group Commitment'' a notion of ''Social Commitment'' is to be defined. ''Social commitment'' is not an individual Commitment shared by many agents; it is the Commitment of one agent to another. The normative contents (entitlements / obligations) of this social relation are stressed and its connections with individual intentions and collective activity. On that basis, a notion of Organizational Commitment is proposed, that could account for the structure of stable Organizations. Commitment is a crucial notion both to analyse the structure of Organizations and to support cooperative work, but a deeper analysis is needed, connecting agent's mental states with social relations and structure.},

It has been shown that the {\textquotedblleft}social{\textquotedblright} agents, which both give and ask for help, are the most successful, and may be able to tolerate very well the presence of exploiters. In this paper the robustness of the social strategy is tested by putting help-giving under risky conditions. The following three variables have been manipulated: number of resources available; threshold triggering the help-giving behavior; and ratio between different kinds of exploiters and social agents. The results show that, with a few exceptions, the social strategy is quite robust in several risky conditions. Some considerations about the usefulness of such a strategy for multi-agent systems are also outlined.},

The evolution plays also a key role in creation and organization of social structures.

 abstract     = {We take up a meeting task where agents try to gather into a single location starting from distributed arrangements. An efficient solution is one in which all agents work simultaneously, and in which the meeting location determines adaptively. However, the difficulty with this solution is that the agents, and hence the meeting location, will move unpredictably. We evaluate a dynamic solution that uses the trailblazer search as the search strategy of agents. Considering the tradeoff between reaction time and number of moves, the trailblazer search is an algorithm that dynamically maintains a map of where an agent has already searched through in the problem space (Chimura     Tokoro 94). Through a simple simulation we show the effect of agents maintaining maps, hence show that mapping functions can facilitate cooperation in meeting tasks.},

Elaboration tolerance is a vital property for building situated agents: it allows for adapting and re-using a previous problem representation in different (but related) situations, rather than building a new representation from scratch. We substantiate our claims by discussing a number of variations to a paradigmatic case study, the Three Wise Men problem.},

The objects in AprilQ++ can have knowledge bases comprising sets of facts and recursive definitions of relations which can be queried, both locally and remotely, using Prolog style queries. AprilQ++ has one other significant feature. Using the higher order features of the underlying April, objects can be cloned, with the current state of the object encapsulated in a procedure closure. The clone can then migrate to be forked as a new active object running on a new host. This features enables us to implement mobile agents.},

Indeed, numerous projects have shown how the language can profitably support interoperation among distributed agents. However, before becoming a widely-accepted standard, it would be worthwhile to examine the language in detail. This paper explores semantical issues raised by KQML, specifically the use of performatives for interagent communication. Numerous difficulties with the language are identified, and an attempt is made to point to their resolution. The paper illustrates the kind of semantics we believe to be necessary to characterize agent communication languages, and applies it to compose a question from a request and an inform. Finally, the paper discusses possible impacts to be felt on various KQML decisions from the semantical issues raised here.},

The CSM is appropriate for negotiation among a group of peers and is also applicable to a manager that must balance conflicting views of its workers. The distributed scheduling algorithm that is used selects a candidate \ensuremath{>}from the priority list of resource requests and inserts that candidate into the evolving timetable. Two protocols are required. The minimax protocol assures equitable power among the peers. The bumping protocol allows reactive scheduling by using a request's total worth to dictate when a new request can seize a previously assigned resource. A request's total worth is the sum of its priority value, its ordering value, and any bonus points received by previous negotiations. Three styles of negotiation are examined: unilateral, verbose, and periodic. Results from sample scenarios are also presented.},

This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current task environment. We show that different combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP allows more agent heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple levels of abstraction.},

A set of prototypical situation/action pairs together with the nearest-neighbor rule represent the behavior of an agent. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in the light of variants of the well-known pursuit game. To this end, we present a classification of variants of the pursuit game, and we report on the results of our approach obtained for variants regarding several aspects of the classification. A first implementation of our approach that utilizes a genetic algorithm to conduct the search for a set of suitable prototypical situation/action pairs was able to handle many different variants.},

The main difficulty of distributed systems, the communication overhead, is dealt with by restricting the work of referees and the supervisor to short moments, called team meetings, that interrupt the work of experts and specialists. The competition and cooperation of experts and specialists in this framework allow for synergetic effects that generate better and faster solutions to the search problems. We demonstrate these effects for instantiations of two very different kinds of search problems, automated theorem proving and optimization problems.},

A significant property of the theory is that it admits the representation of imprecise information at all stages. The strategies are evaluated relative to generalisations of the principle of maximising the expected utility. It is also demonstrated how decision trees can be integrated into the framework and suggest an evaluation rule taking into account all strategies, credibilities, reliabilities, probabilities and utilities involved in the framework. This is done without presupposing the existence of a central co-ordinating agent that evaluates the different reports of the agents.

The theory admits the representation of vague and numerically imprecise information, and the evaluation results in a set of admissible strategies, by using criteria conforming to classical statistical theory.

 abstract     = {Coordination is a central theme of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. Much work in this field can be seen as a search for mechanisms that allow agents with differing knowledge and goals to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit. Additionally, one cornerstone assumption of the field is that communication is expensive relative to local computation. Thus, coordination techniques that minimize communication are of particular importance. This paper considers how automated agents could use a coordination technique common to communication-free human interactions, namely focal points. Given a problem and a set of possible solutions from which the agents need to choose one, focal points are prominent solutions of the problem to which agents are drawn. Theoretical work on this subject includes~i̧teschelling63,kraus91a. The purpose of the current research is to consider the practical use of focal point techniques in various domains. We present simulations over randomly generated domains; these simulations strongly suggest that focal points can act as an effective heuristic for coordination in real-world environments.},

This theory allows us to rigorously describe complex interactions between situated agents. Two kind of interactions are investigated: interactions between an agent and its environment, and interactions between agents through the environment. In this respect, we will show that the second kind is a special case of the first one. Although many theories about action are based on mental issues, we rely mainly on {\textquotedblleft}what happens{\textquotedblright} in the world, i.e. the transformations that take place during interaction. Therefore, as shown in this paper, this theory is general enough to deal with both tropistic (reactive agents) and hysteretic (agents with memory) agents as special cases of general multiagent systems.},

Experimental results are provided evaluating the performance of different cooperative scheduling strategies. Although the concepts for resource scheduling are presented solely for the transportation domain, their abstraction is useful for a broad variety of resource allocation problems. The MARS system solves the dynamic scheduling problem where no complete specification of the problem is available a priori; thus, it is designed as an on-line system based upon anytime algorithms.},

It is based on three general functions describing how the actions an agent commits to are derived from its perception and from its mental model: belief revision and abstraction, situation recognition and goal activation, and planning and scheduling. It is argued that each InteRRaP control layer - the behaviour-based layer, the local planning layer, and the cooperative planning layer - can be described by a combination of different instantiations of these control functions. The basic structure of a control layer is defined. The individual functions and their implementation in the different layers are outlined.},

The overall task to be decomposed is specified in an extended version of TAEMS task modeling framework in which task quality and execution time are uncertain before execution and are represented in the form of a probability distribution. The master agent generates and assigns an initial subtask schedule to agents, and if necessary will revise agent schedules whenever agents make rescheduling requests. These requests are based on the degree of deviation that has occurred in expected quality and duration as a result of actual method execution. Evaluations of scheduler performance indicate a phase transition of rescheduling efficiency with respect to problem difficulty. Specifically, while frequent rescheduling was ineffective for both very easy and very difficult problems, it was extremely effective in the transition region (mid-range) of difficulty.},

Our experiments show how the calendar and preference privacy affect the schedulling efficiency and the meeting joint quality under different experimental scenarios. The results show how the schedulling performance is more stable and constant when agents try to keep both calendar and preference privacy. We believe that these parameters play a key role in the distributed meeting scheduling task, specially if we are interested in building distributed systems with truly autonomous and independent agents where there is not a fixed centralized host agent.},

In this paper, we defend a model of goals and intentions, based on deductive structures, and an integrated framework for revising them, that can and has been adopted as a specification for designing and building up artificial agents. The development of our model has guided the parallel development of a workbench, and experimentation with earlier versions of the workbench has in turn provided guidance for the refinement and extension of the conceptual model.

Already, these new societies have encountered problems endemic to human communities, such as overusing common resources with thrashing over virtual memory and competition by packets for network time. Unlike with human societies, these inefficiencies can be overcome by re-working the algorithms governing the protocols. However, the public good problem, in which a common good is available to all regardless of contribution, can arise computationally in more subtle ways. We discuss how this can happen using Braess' Paradox and demonstrate that adding resources to a computational system can counterintuitively lower the overall performance. This is thus a case in which distributed algorithms are provably unable to achieve globally optimal performance. We illustrate our claim using a genetic algorithm and computational ecosystem.},

The advantage of our solution method is that always yields the optimal solution, which is the rational action of the agent in a multi-agent environment, given the agent's state of knowledge and its preferences, and that it works in realistic cases when agents have only a finite amount of information about the agents they interact with. Our framework can be used to investigate the rational communicative behavior.

Our system can recognize, in real time, temporal positions of beats in real-world audio signals that contain sounds of various instruments. Our application of multiple-agent architecture enables the system to handle ambiguous situations in interpreting real-world input signals and to examine multiple hypotheses of beat positions in parallel. Even if some agents lose track of beats, other agents will keep the correct hypothesis. These agents have been implemented on different processing elements in a parallel computer.

This paper introduces our quantitative analysis of protocol dynamics which is essential for constructing continuous realtime applications. In this paper, a simulation independent of any application has been carried out in order to analyze the dynamic properties of the CNP. We have obtained the following results: the contractor utility increases together with the system load while the manager utility decreases; when the number of agents increases, the contractor utility rises while the manager utility does not change; the uniformity of agents causes the concentration of {\textquotedblleft}bids{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}awards,{\textquotedblright} and thus decreases the manager and the contractor utility. Furthermore, we apply our simulation results to analyze Enterprise, a famous application of the CNP, and point out the problem which might arise in Enterprise.},

For this purpose we develop a formal theory with an internal perspective, which enables us to identify the key data structures and specify the relationships between them. The reasoning processes are described in terms of beliefs, desires and intentions of individual agents. The logical model of these attitudes are used to formally define a number of important states including agent to agent commitment. The reasoning processes are in essence the transitions through these states, specified by a set of rules as part of our specification language. As a result of these processes, an agent may adopt goals to communicate. These goals are fed back into the reasoning process to find appropriate communication plans that fulfill them. Our approach is therefore pragmatic since it enables a direct coupling of our theoretical concepts to an implementable model.},

Not only the sender of a message intends to communicate, but also the receiver is normally motivated to know the semantic content of the message intended by the sender, even if the receiver doubts the sender's honesty. The present paper accounts for how autonomous agents as selfish utility maximizers naturally cooperate in reaching a common optimal mapping between messages and their contents, raising the robustness of communication. An occasion of communication between two agents can be generally formalized as a non-cooperative n-person game (usually n\ensuremath{>}2), and the optimal mapping is shown to be obtained as a Nash equilibrium which maximizes the agents' expected utility over all the possible occasions of communication. Some regularities in natural language pragmatics are demonstrated to follow from this account.},

Directed improvisation also presents distinctive agent requirements that make it a useful addition to the domain of multiagent paradigms: demand for situated, spontaneous, opportunistic behavior; demand for very intimate agent interaction and shared control; and emphasis on process-oriented evaluation criteria.},

Each generation of the population of agents is placed into the Simulator with the ultimate goal of producing an agent capable of surviving any environment. The environment that an agent is presented consists of other agents, mines, and energy. The goal of this research is to construct a program which when executed will allow an agent (or agents) to correctly sense, and mark, the presence of items (energy and mines) in any environment. The Simulator determines the raw fitness of each agent by interpreting the associated program. General programs are evolved to solve this problem. Different environmental setups are presented to show the generality of the solution. These environments include one agent in a fixed environment, one agent in a fluctuating environment, and multiple agents in a fluctuating environment cooperating together. The genetic programming technique was extremely successful. The average fitness per generation in all three environments tested showed steady improvement. Programs were successfully generated that enabled an agent to handle any possible environment.},

This domain has been extensively studied in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) as an easy-to-describe but difficult-to-solve cooperation problem. The evolved programs from our systems are competitive with manually derived greedy algorithms. In particular the STGP paradigm evolved strategies in which the predators were able to achieve their goal without explicitly sensing the location of other predators or communicating with other predators. This is an improvement over previous research in this area. The results of our experiments indicate that STGP is able to evolve programs that perform significantly better than GP evolved programs.

However, in some problems, the utility of coalitions is not easily obtainable because it might depend on uncertainty of other agents' problem solving. We describe a model of coalition formation where agents form coalitions for breaking deadlocks. In this model, agents solve distributed constraint satisfaction problem with an iterative repair method and form coalitions when they get stuck at local minima. This model is suggested to realize new approach to coalition formation. We also present experimental results on problem solving strategies in coalitions: the selfish and the altruistic.},

In the high-speed domain, the propagation delay in a network causes significant problems. One of them is that any centralized control is too late to maintain normal network operations, so distributed traffic control by autonomous agents is required. The basic idea of our traffic control for high-speed networks is a combination of distributed local control and centralized global control; that is, before the global control becomes effective, all network nodes try to maintain their operations in cooperation with other nodes. The significance of propagation delay in such networks requires that the communication delay is included in the model of the node agents. This paper proposes a multiagent traffic control and illustrates the experimental results. The results show that the control based on the multiagent system can improve the efficiency of network control.},

We define the concept of a self-fulfilling equilibrium, where all agents' expectations are realized, and each agent responds optimally to its expectations. We present a generic multiagent exchange situation, in which the competitive equilibrium is self-fulfilling. We then introduce an agent that executes a more sophisticated strategic learning strategy, building a model of the response of other agents. We found that the system reliably converges to a self-fulfilling equilibrium, but that depending on its initial belief, the strategic learning agent may be better or worse off than had it not attempted to learn a model of the other agents at all.},

 abstract     = {This paper investigates real-time bidirectional search (RTBS) algorithms, where two problem solving agents, starting from the initial and goal states, physically move toward each other. To evaluate the RTBS performance, two kinds of algorithms are proposed and are compared to real-time unidirectional search (RTUS). One is called centralized RTBS where a supervisor always selects the best action from all possible moves of the two problem solvers. The other is called decoupled RTBS where no supervisor exists and the two problem solvers independently select their next moves. Experiments on mazes and n-puzzles show that (1) in clear situations decoupled RTBS performs better, while in uncertain situations, centralized RTBS becomes more efficient, and that (2) RTBS is more efficient than RTUS for 15- and 24-puzzles but not for randomly generated mazes. It will be shown that the selection of the multi-agent organization is the selection of the problem space, which determines the baseline of the organizational efficiency; once a hard problem space is selected, the local coordination among problem solvers cannot overcome the deficit.},

To increase office productivity with computer software, both personal and group work should be supported. However, the currently available office work support software, such as groupware or a software secretary, focuses on either of these activities. In this paper, a multiagent-based office work support system and its architecture are introduced. In this system, there exist agents for group and personal work, and they are mutually connected in a two-layered agent network. With the support of these agents, people in an office can expect to efficiently perform both their group and personal work.},

The following three factors are essential in this algorithm: 1) the observability conditions of fluents and actions, 2) the directindirect effects of each action, and 3) the incompatibility of fluents. The algorithm performs backward reasoning from a query, and is implemented in Prolog. It has been tested by dozens of examples through a graphic interface. Experiments show the system gives plausible answers to various queries. This method will be useful in the construction of plan recognition systems and other advanced systems.},

The notion is based upon our intuition that mutual beliefs obtained in message exchanges are inherently of nonmonotonic nature in the sense that they are revocable by the negating evidences obtained later. We point out that there are two aspects to the notion of defeasible knowledge: optimism and error discovery. We give an analysis of defeasible knowledge within the framework of an epistemic temporal modal logic over distributed systems, and propose a set of conditions for defeasible mutual knowledge. We examine a simple message transmission example and show that confirmations are necessary to obtain defeasible mutual knowledge. We also examine organizational structures for defeasible mutual knowledge for larger groups.},

Secondly, based on task, method and phase abstraction of the information processing architecture, a distributed heterogenous computational architecture of symbolic and sub-symbolic agents is developed. Issues associated with computational architecture like communication, parallelism, learning, and others are then discussed. The architecture has been applied in building a real time alrm processing system in a power system control centre with encouraging performance results. About 60 rules and 20 artificial neural networks have been used in alarm processing system.},

This can help the designer to become clear about the design and the correctness of the implementation. Our agent algebra can thus aid in making MAS suitable for control of safety critical systems such as flight control. Our agent algebra, whose terms, structured operational semantics and laws are described in this paper, focuses on interaction of agents. Thus, our agent algebra is especially suited for the description of cooperation and conflict (which is a major concern in MAS) among agents.},

Each agent observes the distances from others and moves as it becomes parted from or approaches others, in contrast it simply moves randomly in the original MARTA*. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate repulsion and attraction are effective in both search time and solution quality for Maze and 15-puzzle respectively. However, the opposite combinations of strategy and problem degrade the performance. We finally discuss why the effectiveness of organizational strategy depends on the problem from a viewpoint of heuristic depression. Observed results suggest that there is a fertile research field which crosses over the traditional heuristic search and the organizational approach in multi-agent environment.},

 abstract     = {A novel approach towards the recognition of interdatabase dependencies (IDD) using a federative agent system FCSI is presented. The architecture of the FCSI is designed as a system of cooperative intelligent autonomous agents each of them uniquely assigned to one local database system. The FCSI aims for a cooperative solution for the problem of finding semantically related information while strictly respecting the autonomy requirements of each individual database system. For this purpose first a descriptive, terminological meta-knowledge and domain information representation DIT on top of the local conceptual database schema is built at each agent by using user-specified intentional scripts. In addition, a respectively instantiated actual aspect world W enables a more flexible representation of schema object aspects. According to a prior known set of common terminological primitives cpc of respective local DITs remote terminological classification then serves as a basis for the discovery of intentional IDDs (i-IDD) between objects of different schemas with respect to some or all of their sofar related intentional interpretation aspects. Projections on respective associated aspect valuations at schema and state level isps determine context-based data sharing and result in restricted proposals for interdatabase schema assertions (IDSA).
 In order to organize a cooperative recognition process of i-IDDs between the autonomous FCSI agents a method for decentralized utilitaristic coalition formation is presented. Moreover, each rational FCSI agent can participate in several different coalitions based on different types of coalition utilities. In this paper the current status of ongoing research on the FCSI is reported.},

They may either work as individuals or efficiently cooperate in order to satisfy their own set of given information search tasks. However, in particular the need to respect the database autonomy requirements and to cope with semantic heterogeneity hinders such a cooperation. In this paper we present a solution for handling the autonomy during decentralized information-gathering by rational cooperation. For this purpose, methods for terminological knowledge representation and inference, as well as for utilitarian coalition formation among the information agents, are used. The decentralized agent-utility calculation bases on the agent's productions, resulting from executing tasks of finding dependencies between local terminological information models. There is no prior need nor a possibility to browse through foreign database schemas in order to find some possibly relevant data. The coalition algorithm proposed in this paper enables efficient cooperation via the formation of Kernel-oriented stable coalitions among rationally cooperating information agents in polynomial time.},

The great number of parameters involved make it difficult for the designer to optimally adapt the structure of the network to a given class of tasks. In this paper we outline possible network structures and present an approach for determining a number of important statistical parameters characterising the network at a relatively abstract level. The abstraction enables a comparison of different network structures. The methods for the analysis may, however, be readily refined to evaluate a specific problem. As an example we discuss the use of the multi-agent paradigm for structuring the cooperation of sensor networks in robotics. Our analysis is supple-mented by simulation results, which prove a superiority of lateral over pure hierarchical coordination, particularly under severe environmental conditions, such as agent failure.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents a language called AgenTalk for describing coordination protocols for multiagent systems. Many coordination protocols such as the contract net protocol have been proposed, and many application-specific coordination protocols are expected to be required soon as more software agents start to be built. However, no general framework has yet been proposed for defining and implementing such coordination protocols. AgenTalk is designed to solve this problem; it allows coordination protocols to be defined incrementally and to be easily customized to suit application domains by incorporating an inheritance mechanism. This paper describes the design policies of AgenTalk and demonstrates its capability by describing the contract net protocol and the multistage negotiation protocol in AgenTalk utilizing its inheritance mechanism. A comparison is made with KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language), and the relationships with related research in distributed artificial intelligence are discussed.},

In an open environment, an agent needs to respond to unexpected situations (exceptions). By introducing a meta-level control mechanism in the coordination protocol execution, an agent can have flexible control over the coordination with other agents. As a meta-level control mechanism, methods to detect and handle exceptions are presented. For example, the proposed mechanism allows an agent to dynamically switch a coordination protocol to use when an exception occurs. In this paper, AgenTalk, a coordination protocol description language, is extended to include primitives for the meta-level control. In this extension, the meta-level control is described using the same mechanism for describing an agent's behavior in a coordination protocol.},

 abstract     = {We have analyzed characteristics of sharable resources and developed techniques for intelligently sharing resources {\textemdash} specifically, communication channels {\textemdash} among agents in multiagent systems. Our techniques allow agents to nearly optimize their communication behavior in a self-organizing and distributed fashion, involving the use of a microeconomic pricing system based on economic laws of supply and demand and trading among agents in real-time. Our analyses are based on three measures of performance: fairness of resource allocation, waiting time for resources, and utilization of resources. Our initial analysis indicates that fairness and utilization are conflicting, in that the best utilization with a fair allocation is equivalent to the worst utilization with an unfair resource allocation, assuming the allocation policy is statically defined. To strike a balance in performance, we have developed mechanisms that establish an artificial economy, where agents can dynamically reallocate goods (resource access) using a competitive market pricing mechanism. However, unlike more common market-oriented methods, our approach does not demand convergence to equilibrium, but permits more rapid, heuristic trading, leading to near optimal performance where both buyers and sellers of resources can benefit. Our studies show that agents employing our mechanisms can dramatically improve utilization while still providing {\textquotedblleft}fair{\textquotedblright} access to the resources.},

 abstract     = {Distributed constraint optimization imposes considerable complexity in agents' coordinated search for an optimal solution. However, in many application domains, problems often exhibit special structures that can be exploited to facilitate more efficient problem solving. One of the most recurrent structures involves disparity among subproblems. We present a coordination mechanism, Anchor   Ascend, for distributed constraint optimization that takes advantage of disparity among subproblems to efficiently guide distributed local search for global optimality. The coordination mechanism assigns different overlapping subproblems to agents who must interact and iteratively converge on a solution. In particular, an anchor agent who conducts local best first search to optimize its subsolution interacts with the rest of the agents who perform distributed constraint satisfaction to enforce problem constraints and constraints imposed by the anchor agent. We focus our study on the well-known NP-complete job shop scheduling problem. We define and study two problem structure measures, disparity ratio and disparity composition ratio. We experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of the Anchor   Ascend mechanism on a suite of job shop scheduling problems over a wide range of values of disparity composition. Our experimental results show that (1) considerable advantage can be obtained by explicitly exploiting disparity (2) disparity composition ratio plays a more important role than disparity ratio in finding high quality solution with little computational cost.},

The look-ahead coordination increases agents' global visibility and provides indicative information for decision adjustment. The goal of our approach is to prune decision myopia while maintaining system responsiveness in real-time, dynamic environments. Experimental results in job shop scheduling problems show that (1) the look-ahead coordination significantly enhances the performance of the standard operating procedure in solution quality, (2) the approach is capable of producing solutions of very high quality in a real-time environment.},

In this work we propose an unsupervised exploration algorithm in which several agents cooperate to acquire knowledge of the environment at the different abstraction levels; a broadcast model is adopted for inter-agent communication. All agents are structurally equal and pursue the same local exploration strategy; nevertheless, the existence of multiple levels of abstraction in the environment representation allows for the agents' behaviours to differentiate. Agents carry out exploration at different abstraction levels, aimed at reproducing an ideal exploration profile; each agent selects dynamically its exploration level, based on the current demand.},

In addition, a variant of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game is suggested, in which players have the choice of opting out. This modification enriches the game and suggests dominance of cooperative strategies. Competitive analysis is suggested as a tool for investigating sub-optimal (but computationally tractable) strategies and game theoretic models in general. Using competitive analysis, it is shown that for bounded players, a sub-optimal strategy might be the optimal choice, given resource limitations.},

However, neither network capabilities nor users' time and money are infinite. Computational markets provide one type of mechanism for allocating limited resources in such an environment in a distributed, dynamic way. Moreover, the underlying economic theory provides an analytical framework for predicting aggregate behavior and designing individual agents. In this paper, we describe a prototypical computational market model for information services distributed over a network. Our initial focus is on the economic problem of when and where to establish mirror sites for the more popular information services. Competitive agents choose to set up mirrors based on going prices for network bandwidth, computational resources, and the information service. Depending on the experimental setup, we observed a range of qualitative behaviors.},

Our model is based on a sharp distinction between the environment and agent dynamics. In particular, it allows to express how the environment is modified by simultaneously performed actions, to formalize in a very general way the internal activity of an agent in terms of its decision processes (which are based on its own perceptions), and finally to describe the interactions between the agents and the environment, and among themselves. In the application to automated deduction, we integrate our model with the concept of OMRS (Open Mechanized Reasoning System) which distinguishes the logical, the control, and the interaction components of a theorem prover. In this setting, the environment consists of the proof structure, represented as a labelled graph, built when trying to prove a conjecture. The agents, described as OMRS, are situated on the nodes of this graph and act on its nodes and edges (e.g. they may add new nodes). Some experimental results based on a simple example are provided in order to illustrate the potentialities of our approach.},

We introduce a special agent called a real world agent. A real world agent is a software agent that can support its user in performing tasks in real world environments, such as place-to-place location guidance, instruction in physical tasks, and augmentation of human knowledge related to the physical environment. In order for the agent to achieve these tasks, the agent should be aware of the user's real world situation. The detection of real world situations is performed through the integration of various methods, including location-awareness using a global positioning system, object recognition through machine-recognizable IDs (barcodes, infrared rays, etc.), and the processing of visual/spoken inputs. IDs of static objects (e.g., doors, ceilings, walls, etc.) can also give clues to the location-awareness system. When a real world agent correctly deduces the real world situation and the intentions of its user, it can access information worlds (e.g., the Internet) in the same manner as other software agents. In this way, the real world and information worlds can be dynamically integrated. Real world agents can detect real world situations, interact with humans, and perform tasks in information space.},

For controlling multiple robots, Contract Net Protocol(CNP) is useful, but the broadcast of the Task Announcement messages on CNP tends to consume much communication load. So LEMMING learns proper addressees for the Task Announcement messages with Case-Based Reasoning so as to suppress the broadcast. The learning method is called Addressee Learning. In this paper, we extend LEMMING with `directed contract' to reduce the communication load more effectively. Moreover, we extend LEMMING with `forgetting' to restrict the number of cases, since it is impossible to have enough memory to keep all the cases. The efficiency of LEMMING is evaluated in a simulated multi-robot environment to show that these extension are effective for LEMMING.},

In this paper, we consider a modified version of the Pursuit Problem as a multi-agent learning problem which is computationally intractable by these straightforward approaches. We show how successfully a collection of modular Q-learning hunter agents synthesize coordinated decision policies needed to capture a randomly-fleeing prey agent effectively, by specializing their individual functionality and synthesizing herding behavior.},

The adaptive organization changes its organizational scheme adaptively as a means of coping with the dynamic problem spaces. Preliminary experiments shows that an adaptive organization can be made to the increase efficiency in dynamic problem spaces. The reason for this works is that reducing the degree of freedom in the problem space, while increasing the degree of interaction, demands greater coordination. However, if the number of effective local plans decrease, it would seem likely that if the agents were to have a better metalevel strategy, they would be better able to search this reduced space efficiently. The metalevel coordination incorporates an agent-wide metalevel heuristic function. In designing the metalevel coordination strategy, we take three aspects of reactive cooperative planning into account. These aspects include: the difference in the degree of achievement in successive turns; the certainty of shared information; and the degree of freedom of choice for agent's behavior. The adaptive organization works efficiently in cases where the communication cost is relatively expensive.},

For instance, a self-interested agent (contractee) will perform a task of another agent (contractor) only when doing it is its own interest, and therefore to form a successful contract, the contractor needs to provide incentives to the contractee, such as proposing a payment higher than the contractee's cost of doing the task. In this paper, we focus on the contractor's strategic decision problem of what payment to offer to maximize its expected utility, and propose a method for a self-interested contractor to determine the best payment to offer. We present a four-step decision-making mechanism using a stochastic Markov-process (MP) model, which captures various factors that influence the utility value and uncertainties associated with them. The MP-based mechanism enables a contractor to choose different optimal payments depending on the payment(s) of the other contractor(s) or the contractees' costs of doing the task, and therefore to receive a better profit. The experiment demonstrates strategic thinking-thinking about not only oneself but also the contractees and the other competing contractors-is indeed advantageous.},

Using Distributed Data Processing as an example domain, we show how different coordination algorithms of varying sophistication give rise to subtle effects in functionally-structured agent organizations with interrelationships between functions.

This paper explores a particular type of rational agent, a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent. The primary aim of this paper is to integrate (a) the theoretical foundations of BDI agents from both a quantitative decision-theoretic perspective and a symbolic reasoning perspective; (b) the implementations of BDI agents \ensuremath{>}from an ideal theoretical perspective and a more practical perspective; and (c) the building of large-scale applications based on BDI agents. In particular, an air-traffic management application will be analyzed from both a theoretical and an implementation perspective.},

These issues are presented in the context of iterative task allocation negotiations. First, the reasons why such agents need to be able to choose the stage and level of commitment dynamically are identified. A protocol that allows such choices through conditional commitment breaking penalties is presented. Next, the implications of bounded rationality are analyzed. Several tradeoffs between allocated computation and negotiation benefits and risk are enumerated, and the necessity of explicit local deliberation control is substantiated. Techniques for linking negotiation items and multiagent contracts are presented as methods for escaping local optima in the task allocation process. Implementing both methods among self-interested bounded rational agents is discussed. Finally, the problem of message congestion among self-interested agents is described, and alternative remedies are presented.},

 abstract     = {Auctions provide an efficient distributed mechanism for solving problems such as task and resource allocation in multiagent systems. In the Vickrey auction - which has been widely advocated for automated auctions - the best bid wins the auction, but at the second best price. In certain settings this promotes truthful bidding and avoids counterspeculation. This paper analyses the circumstances when this protocol is appropriate, and explicates the desirable properties and lack thereof in varied settings. The first part of the paper discusses known deficiencies of the Vickrey auction: bidder collusion, a lying auctioneer, promotion of lying in non-private-value auctions, lower revenue than alternative protocols, and the necessity to reveal sensitive information. The second part of the paper presents our results regarding new limitations of the protocol, which arise especially among computational agents. These include inefficient allocation and lying in sequential auctions of interrelated items, untruthful bidding when a risk averse agent has local uncertainty, and the need for counterspeculation to make deliberation control (or information gathering) decisions when an agent has local uncertainty.},

 abstract     = {Q-learning is a recent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that does not need a model of its environment and can be used on-line. Therefore it is well-suited for use in repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL research has been confined to single agent settings or to multiagent settings where the agents have totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems) or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum games). This paper is an empirical study of reinforcement learning in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither totally positively nor totally negatively correlated. RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain. This paper investigates the ability of a variety of Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent is the fixed strategy Tit-for-Tat, while in others it is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to play optimally against Tit-for-Tat. Playing against another learner was more difficult because the adaptation of the other learner creates a nonstationary environment in ways that are detailed in the paper. The learners that were studied varied along three dimensions: the length of history they received as context, the type of memory they employed (lookup tables based on restricted history windows or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that can theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in the past), and the exploration schedule they followed. Although all the learners faced difficulties when playing against other learners, agents with longer history windows, lookup table memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best in the IPD games.},

We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, improtan features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local inforamtion available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive beehavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and expose various phenomena related to the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. In addition, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even deteriorate system efficiency.},

 abstract     = {Distributed planning is fundamental to the generation of co-operative activities in Multi-Agent Systems. It requires both an adequate plan representation and efficient interacting methods allowing agents to coordinate their plans. This paper proposes a recursive model for the representation and the handling of plans by means of Recursive Petri Nets (RPN) which support the specification of concurrent activities, reasoning about simultaneous actions and continuous processes, a theory of verification and mechanisms of transformation (e.g. abstraction, refinement, merging). The main features of the RPN formalism are domain independence, broad coverage of interacting situations and operational coordination. This paper also provides an approach to the interleaving of execution and planning which is based on the RPN semantics and gives some significant methods allowing plan management in distributed planning. It goes on to show how this approach can be used to coordinate agents' plans in a shared and dynamic environment.},
