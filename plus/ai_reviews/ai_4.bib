These techniques are therefore useful for building and checking parametric models, as well as for data description. Kernel and nearest-neighbor regression estimators are local versions of univariate location estimators, and so they can readily be introduced to beginning students and consulting clients who are familiar with such summaries as the sample mean and median.},
