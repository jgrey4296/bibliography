There is already a need for an information technology infrastructure that goes well beyond the simple capabilities offered by the current development environments for Internet applications. For electronic commerce to really take off, however, it will have to give shoppers options not available through traditional commercial channels. This implies the further need for an infrastructure that can support complex and flexible services to manage customer-tailored requests in the context of highly dynamic networks and federations of providers. To address these issues, we developed XPect, a generic framework for electronic commerce. The XPect framework supports the integration of multiple component functionalities. It is implemented in the Coordination Language Facility, an object-based distributed application development tool that assumes an object model of autonomous agents that can engage in interactions more sophisticated than those in the traditional object paradigm. In addition, CLF allows for dynamically adding new services and for coordinating the access to multiple services.},

In fact, this environment, called HOMAGE, offers two different programming levels: object and agent. The object level allows the use of three object-oriented programming languages (C++, Common Lisp and Java) to develop the components that will be used to build the body of agents. The agent level allows the development of new agents by defining their {\textquotedblleft}brain{\textquotedblright} and by composing the components defined at the object level, and allows the development of multi-agent systems by distributing and interconnecting agent instances. Moreover, these multi-agent systems can be distributed on a net of heterogeneous machines connected through internet taking advantage of a set of communication and distribution libraries allowing the communication between agents through different protocols. The paper includes a brief description of a robotic application that we implemented during the experimentation of the environment.},

In this paper we analyze how to overcome these problems by new design paradigms and technologies encompassing the capability to relocate dynamically the components of a distributed application. We evaluate the opportunities offered by this approach and provide feasibility considerations, also discussing a few interim architectural solutions adopted in our on-going implementation work.},

 abstract     = {Driven by the question how to identify potential communication partners and the need for well-suited communication schemes in agent-based systems, we discuss two communication concepts: sessions and global event management. Sessions establish either actively or passively a context for inter-agent interactions. Communication partners are addressed by globally unique agent identifiers or via badges. Communication in sessions is based on RPC or message mechanisms. Global event management addresses the need for anonymous communication. Event managers are employed as a synchronization means within agent groups. Based on this approach, we introduce synchronization objects, {\textendash} active components that offer various synchronization services. The presented model is finally mapped onto OMG event services.},

In this paper we introduce our model of agent groups in mobile agent environ ments. Various entities of an agent group are consecutively identified and their roles within an electronic market scenario thoroughly pictured. We argue that with the ac curate employment of the provided agent group primitives the system's flexibility can be significantly enhanced: user applications can, for example, trade performance against fault-tolerance.},

This framework, DESIRE (framework for DEsign and Specification of Interacting REasoning components), explicitly models the knowledge, interaction, and coordination of complex tasks and reasoning capabilities in agent systems. For the application domain addressed in this paper, an operational multi-agent system which manages an electricity transportation network for a Spanish electricity utility, a comprehensible specification is presented.},

Their development, however, is not yet supported by a sound technological and methodological background, as the results developed for small size distributed systems often do not scale up. Recently, mobile code languages (MCLs) have been proposed as a technological answer to the problem. In this work, we abstract away from the details of these languages by deriving design paradigms exploiting code mobility that are independent of any particular technology. We present such design paradigms, together with a discussion of their features, their application domain, and some hints about the selection of the correct paradigm for a given distributed application.},

 abstract     = {In this chapter we are going to analyze mobile code issues in the perspective of object oriented systems in which thread migration is not supported. This means that both object's code and data can be transmitted from a place to another but not the current execution state (if any) associated to the object. This is the case with the Java language which is often used in the WWW for developing applets which are little applications downloaded on the fly and executed in the client machine. While this mechanism is quite useful for enhancing HTML documents with sound and animation, we think that this technology can give its best in the field of distributed-cooperative work, both in the perspective of Internet and Intranet connectivity. Java is indeed a concurrent, multithreaded language, but it offers little help for distributed programming. Thus, we introduce Jada, a coordination toolkit for Java where coordination among either concurrent threads or distributed Java objects is achieved via shared object spaces. By exchanging objects through tuple spaces, Java programs and applets can exchange data or synchronize their actions over a single host, a LAN, or even the Internet. The access to an object space is performed using a set of methods of the ObjectSpace class. Such operations are Out (to put an object in the object space), In and Read (to get or to read associatively an object from the object space), and others, mostly inspired by the Linda language. Jada does not extends the syntax of Java because it is a set of classes. We show how it changes the way we design multiuser, distributed applications (such as the ones based on the WWW) allowing easy interactions between software components and agents. Under this perspective we can outline a system of any scale which uses the dynamic linking capability of Java to distribute the code and the coordination facility of Jada to handle distributed entities inter-relations.},

 abstract     = {With the continuing exponential growth of the Internet and the more recent growth of business Intranets, the commercial world is becoming increasingly aware of the problem of electronic information overload. This has encouraged interest in developing agents/softbots that can act as electronic personal assistants and can develop and adapt representations of users information needs, commonly known as profiles. As the result of collaborative research with Friends of the Earth, an environmental issues campaigning organisation, we have developed a general purpose information classification agent architecture and have applied it to the problem of document classification and routing. Collaboration with Friends of the Earth allows us to test our ideas in a non-academic context involving high volumes of documents. We use the technique of genetic programming (GP), (Koza and Rice 1992), to evolve classifying agents. This is a novel approach for document classification, where each agent evolves a parse-tree representation of a user's particular information need. The other unusual features of our research are the longevity of our agents and the fact that they undergo a continual training process; feedback from the user enables the agent to adapt to the user's long-term information requirements.},

Jasper provides agents which can retrieve relevant WWW pages quickly and easily. A Jasper agent holds a profile of its user, based on observing their behaviour and learning more about their interests as the system is used. A novel three-dimensional front end for the Jasper system has been created using VRML (virtual reality modelling language), a language for 3-D graphical spaces or virtual worlds networked via the global Internet and hyperlinked within WWW. This and other ongoing research using keyword and document clustering techniques are described.},

Static typing and dynamic linking interact in a security-relevant way. This interaction is the subject of this paper. One solution is modeled in PVS, and formally proven to be safe.},

Using computation spaces, the paper covers several inference engines ranging from standard search strategies to techniques new to constraint programming, including limited discrepancy search, visual search, and saturation. Saturation is an inference method for tautology-checking used in industrial practice. Computation spaces have shown their practicability in the constraint programming system Oz.},

The constraints of any node in the tree are available first-class: predefined or user-defined procedures can be used to display or analyze them. The Explorer is a fast and memory efficient tool intended for the development of real-world constraint programs. The Explorer is implemented in Oz using first-class computation spaces. There is no fixed search strategy in Oz. Instead, first-class computation spaces allow to program search engines. The Explorer is one particular example of a user-guided search engine.

 abstract     = {We are designing and implementing a flexible infrastructure for mobile-object systems. Two fundamental innovations distinguish our architecture from other proposed solutions. First, our representation of mobile code is based on adaptive compression of syntax trees. Not only is this representation more than twice as dense as Java byte-codes, but it also encodes semantic information on a much higher level than linear abstract-machine representations such as p-code or Java byte-codes. The extra structural information that is contained in our mobile-code format is directly beneficial for advanced code optimizations. Second, our architecture achieves superior run-time performance by integrating the activity of generating executable code into the operating system itself. Rather than being an auxiliary function performed off-line by a stand-alone compiler, code generation constitutes a central, indispensable service in our system. Our integral code generator has two distinct modes of operation: instantaneous load-time translation and continuous dynamic re-optimization. In contrast to just-in-time compilers that translate individual procedures on a call-by-call basis, our system's integral code-generator translates complete code-closures in a single burst during loading. This has the apparent disadvantage that it introduces a minor delay prior to the start of execution. As a consequence, to some extent we have to favor compilation speed over code quality at load time. But then, the second operation mode of our embedded code generator soon corrects this shortcoming. Central to our run-time architecture is a thread of activity that continually optimizes all of the already executing software in the background. Since this is strictly a re-compilation of already existing code, and since it occurs completely in the background, speed is not critical, so that aggressive, albeit slow, optimization techniques can be employed. Upon completion, the previously executing version of the same code is supplanted by the newly generated one and re-optimization starts over. By constructing globally optimized code-images from mobile software components, our architecture is able to reconcile dynamic composability with the run-time efficiency of monolithic applications.},

We argue that these mobile, autonomous agents have the potential to provide a convenient, efficient and robust programming paradigm for distributed applications, particularly when partially connected computers are involved. Partially connected computers include mobile computers such as laptops and personal digital assistants as well as modem-connected home computers, all of which are often disconnected from the network. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of our mobile-agent system, Agent Tcl, and the specific features that support mobile computers and disconnected operation. These features include network-sensing tools and a docking system that allows an agent to transparently move between mobile computers, regardless of when the computers connect to the network.},

 abstract     = {The recent trend towards dynamically extensible systems holds the promise of more powerful and flexible systems. At the same time, the impact of extensibility on overall system security and, specifically, access control is still ill understood, and protection mechanisms in these extensible systems are rudimentary at best. In this paper, we identify the structure of extensible systems as it relates to system security, and present an access control mechanism that is user-friendly and complete. The mechanism, by using ideas first introduced by the security community, offers mandatory access control which can be used to enforce a given security policy. Additional discretionary access control allows users to express their own fine-grained access constraints. We introduce a new access mode, called the extend access mode, in addition to the familiar execute access mode, to reflect how extensions interact. Furthermore, in a departure from work in the security community, we treat both extensions and threads of control as subjects, i.e., as active entities, in order to correctly capture their interaction in an extensible system. We present the design of the access control mechanism and define a formal model. We describe an implementation of the access control mechanism in the SPIN extensible operating system, which allows us to evaluate its performance and to explore optimizations that reduce the overhead of access control. The measured end-to-end overhead of access control in our system is less than 2},

 abstract     = {Use of mobile code can make distributed systems and the abstractions they provide more flexible to build and use. Richer functionality can be given to the interaction between processes by allowing code to be sent between them. More convenient, application-level operations can be made over a network. By making higher order language features transmissible, distributed components can be tightly bound together when they communicate. At the same time, familiar distributed systems can be built using mobile code. Mobile code can make distributed systems adaptable to application needs. Rather than fixing the interface to a resource and the pattern of interaction with it, a minimal interface can be defined and code implementing higher-level interfaces placed alongside it as and when required. These higher-level interfaces can be application-specific, allowing for interaction patterns that were unknown at the time the resource was made available. Sending code close to a resource can also reduce network usage because the point of interaction with it moves. The combination of document markup supporting hypertext and a language supporting state-saving allows for stateful client-server sessions with stateless servers and lightweight clients. Putting dormant mobile code in documents provides an alternative to holding knowledge of application functionality on a server machine or running arbitrary code on a client machine. Mobile code helps to support user mobility. Personalised environments that support state-saving can follow a user between computers. Heterogeneous state-saving allows a user's programs to be relocated between computers. By using a mobile code system with language support for state-saving, applications can direct arbitrary component migration without priming program servers with specific support. In summary, this dissertation supports the thesis that mobile code can be used to enhance distributed systems.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are often described as a promising technology moving towards the vision of a widely distributed scalable electronic market. The deployment of electronic services, especially in the area of electronic commerce, raises essential questions closely related to security issues. This paper tries to address these issues by providing a taxonomy of security domains within mobile agent systems. The identified areas comprise protecting hosts against malicious agents, protecting agents from other agents, protecting hosts from other hosts, and protecting agents from malicious hosts. Whereas the first three security issues can be solved by applying traditional security mech anisms, new security techniques have to be developed to protect agents from malicious hosts. The paper analyzes possible attacks of hosts and presents, based on this analysis, an approach to prevent malicious attacks. The ap proach, which is called Code Mess Up, consists of a combination of two mechanisms: The first mechanism dy namically generates a new and far less understandable version of the agent code. The second mechanism restricts the lifetime of the agent's code and data. It is shown that the application of these two mechanism can significantly enhance the protection of agents against malicious hosts.},

 abstract     = {Active networking introduces a new flexible network service paradigm. The passive data carrier is changed to an active, dynamically configurable, data-transport-service machine, through the possibility of performing computation in the network nodes. Utilization of mobile agents allows to deliver service tasks to any place in the network. An agent can execute adaptive filtering on the bypassing data streams, do user intended signalling and handle network management tasks in a distributed manner. Looking at the aspects of network services, benefits arise from the fact that the transmission protocols can be tailored to the application by providing filtering or format conversion within the network. The 'one fits all' approach, like TCP/UDP which can just handle end-to-end loss control are strongly improved. Generally speaking there are two ways in providing active services in the network: the full user based approach, allowing the end user to distribute its own, application dependent stream forwarding agent. It can be used in the open Internet where the mobile agents can provide bridges over legacy systems. Or, the layered approach, giving only the administrator of the network the possibility to deploy new service classes within the network. This is particularly interesting in a Intranet scenario, permitting to deploy new services rapidly and granting the user only the execution of the new service. We are also concerned by service and system security and failure protection aspects of this approach: When an agent becomes mobile and it includes the possibility to reproduce child agents in any number, the problems of agent flooding become apparent. Therefore solutions have to be proposed to guarantee, that the agents which get lost or out of control, will time out and return to their home, or die immediately. A possible solution based on credits is presented and discussed. This paper reviews efforts in the research domain: including the Active IP projects at MIT, the Active Networking project at Georgia Institute of Technology and the NetScript approach from Columbia University. Our alternative approach is presented, which allows fast service deployment, examples of service usage and a service and system security concept for the proposed architecture.},

 abstract     = {Wireless communication with Mobile Computing devices is known to be problematic. It is very different in character from conventional communication over wired networks. Since many distributed applications make assumptions about network characteristics, they may not be used in a hostile mobile environment. We are proposing a new kind of messaging system which incorporates adaptive behaviour into the messages themselves. We call these 'Smart Messages', and implement them using Mobile Agents. They are transported between machines via Agent Airports. The metaphor we use is of a message being delivered by a courier (Mobile Agent), through Agent Airports, on a potentially unresolved route. The 'intelligence' is in the messages (couriers in our metaphor) themselves rather than in the network. The approach taken expands on the self-routing capabilities of current Mobile Agent systems such as Aglets or Telescript. We aim to provide structured support for handling the particular problems associated with wireless communications. These include very limited, variable and asymmetric bandwidth, frequent and prolonged disconnections, geographical mobility and high usage costs. We argue that this offers an efficient, adaptable and robust solution to many of the problems associated with this hostile communications environment.},

These two branches are related, but not identical, and are often lumped together under the single term {\textquotedblleft}agent{\textquotedblright}. Much agent work can be classified as either being an interface agent, but not autonomous, or as an autonomous agent, but not operating directly in the interface. We show why it is important to have agents that are both interface agents and autonomous agents. We explore some design principles for such agents, and illustrate these principles with a description of Letizia, an autonomous interface agent that makes real-time suggestions for Web pages that a user might be interested in browsing.},

 abstract     = {HTML allows the structural markup of Web documents, distinguishing the elements of a page with tags and declaring the physical relationships among the various document elements. This organizes the display of information and allows humans to read and use it. To give machines this capability, however, requires semantic markup, identifying what each particular element means on its own (for example, 'this is a home street address' or 'this is an e-mail address'). Semantic markup would change what is now simply displayed content to machine-readable, structured content. The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) specification makes it dramatically easier to develop and deploy domain- and mission-specific Web pages. In this article, we describe the evolution of the Webs data representation from display formats to structural markup to semantic markup. The shift from structural HTML markup to semantic XML markup is a critical phase in the struggle to transform the Web from a universal information space into a knowledge network.},

What do these agent systems actually do and, more importantly, what distinguishes one agent system from another? To help answer these questions, we downloaded three of the leading commercial systems-IBMs Aglets, General Magics Odyssey, and ObjectSpaces Voyager-and looked at issues such as ease of installation, feature set, documentation, and cost. We also discuss new capabilities of Java 1.1 that show promise as simple yet powerful means to create mobile agent systems. We conclude with a brief look at the ways in which mobile agents are currently being used and the limitations of todays technologies.},

Quantitative measurements show that these methods can boost absolute and relative performance.},

 abstract     = {Mobile computers have become increasingly popular as users discover the benefits of having their electronic work available at all times. However, because network conditions vary from connection to connection, using Internet resources from a mobile platform is a major challenge. Mobile agents are one solution. A mobile agent is an autonomous program that can move from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network under its own control. It can suspend its execution at any point, transport itself to a new machine, and resume execution on the new machine from the point at which it left off. On each machine, it interacts with service agents and other resources to accomplish its task, returning to its home site with a final result when that task is finished. Agent Tcl is a mobile-agent system whose agents can be written in Tcl, Java, and Scheme. Agent Tcl has extensive navigation and communication services, security mechanisms, and debugging and tracking tools. In this article we focus on Agent Tcls architecture and security mechanisms, its RPC system, and its docking system, which lets an agent move transparently among mobile computers, regardless of when they are connected to the network.},

Second, users should be freed from mundane and repetitive browsing tasks. Third, and most critical, information from the Web should be available in the format and combination that best fit the users task, regardless of the pages on which the information was originally found. This report looks at these issues for Internet automation in the context of new software agent technologies that act as user surrogates for carrying out routine Web activity. Such surrogates, for example, AgentSofts LiveAgents, enable automation of all interactions with HTML pages and forms-not merely the retrieval of specific URLs-and also the flexible integration of Web information into customized reports and other applications.},
