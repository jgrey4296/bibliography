 abstract     = {Mobile agents are programs capable of migrating from one host machine to another. We propose that mobile agents purchase resource access rights from host machines thereby establishing a market for computational resources and giving agents a metric to evenly distribute themselves throughout the network. Market participation requires quantitative information about resource consumption to define demand and calculate utility. We create a formal utility model to derive user-demand functions, allowing agents to efficiently plan expenditure and deal with price fluctuations. By quantifying demand and utility, resource owners can precisely set a value for a good. We simulate our model in a mobile agent scheduling environment and show how mobile agents may use server prices to distribute themselves evenly throughout a network.},

With the growing demand for wireless. satellite, and other highly volatile computer communications networks, however, applications that are robust in the presence of network volatility must be designed and built. Network-robust applications are of great interest in military situations today, and we expect that interest to grow in industrial and eventually consumer environments as well. Mobile agents are one way to realize such applications, especially when used in a wireless environment. This article discusses issues and results related to the problem of making computer applications network-aware and reactive to changing network conditions. It contains a short overview of our work on mobile agents as well as a tutorial on network sensing from the agent perspective. Some prototypes of network-sensing systems and network aware mobile-agent applications are presented.},

 abstract     = {A mobile agent is an autonomous program that can migrate under its own control from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. In other words, the program can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport itself to another machine, and then resume execution from the point of suspension. Mobile agents have the potential to provide a single, general framework in which a wide range of distributed applications can be implemented efficiently and easily. Several challenges must be faced, however, most notably reducing migration overhead, protecting a machine from malicious agents (and an agent from malicious machines), and insulating the agent against network and machine failures. Agent Tcl is a mobile-agent system under development at Dartmouth College that has evolved from a Tcl-only system into a multiple-language system that currently supports Tcl, Java, and Scheme. In this thesis, we examine the motivation behind mobile agents, describe the base Agent Tcl system and its security mechanisms for protecting a machine against malicious agents, and analyze the system's current performance. Finally, we discuss the security, fault-tolerance and performance enhancements that will be necessary for Agent Tcl and mobile agents in general to realize their full potential.},

Each of these formalisms defines a mathematical framework that can be used to reason about mobile code; they vary greatly in the mechanisms they provide to specify mobile code based applications and in their practical usefulness for the validation and the verification of such applications. In this paper we show how these formalisms can be used to represent the mobility and communication aspects of two mobile code environments: Obliq and Messengers. We compare and classify the different formalisms with respect to mobility and discuss some shortcomings and desirable extensions. We also point to other emerging concepts in formalisms for mobile code systems.},

This is done by a special server extension module called 'server agent environment' (SAE). The agents may access local data of the Web server and may communicate with other Web-agents or with human users. The paper discusses the different security issues that arise in such a system and shows how we address the problems. Concerning system and network security, we present a solution based on security packages, protection domains, and agent capabilities. This provides a flexible way to restrict an agent's possibility to access the local server data or access the network. Since we also aim at providing our SAE as a plug-in for other Web servers, we show how this is supported by our system architecture.},

It is argued that such an architecture has the potential to provide a distributed, robust and efficient means of traffic management for telecommunications networks. Some preliminary work on the design of the trading behaviour of the agents in the economy is presented, including the results of experiments which investigate the relative performance of market-based agents compared with traffic management based on static routing.},

In this chapter, we discuss these three issues in the context of D'Agents, a mobile-agent system whose agents can be written in Tcl, Java and Scheme. (D'Agents was formerly known as Agent Tcl.) First we discuss mechanisms existing in D'Agents for protecting an individual machine: (1) cryptographic authentication of the agent's owner, (2) resource managers that make policy decisions based on the owner's identity, and (3) secure execution environments for each language that enforce the decisions of the resource managers. Then we discuss our planned market-based approach for protecting machine groups. Finally we consider several (partial) solutions for protecting an agent from a malicious machine.},

The real-world SPIN testbed is aimed at two difficult applications, namely seamless messaging and intelligent network management. Both applications are agent-driven and share agent behaviours and the messaging agents rely on the network management device diagnostic agents for input. The paper introduces both problem areas in a common testbed. The agent launch tool is described in detail. User-centric seamless messaging assumes heterogeneous communication environments intended to support todays nomadic users. The prototype is introduced for the management of messages across distributed information networks. The aim of it is to intercept, filter, interpret, and deliver multi- modal messages be they voice, fax, video and/or e-mail messages. A users Personal Communication Agent is charged with delivering messages to the recipient regardless of their target messaging device be it a telephone, a pager, a desktop, a wireless laptop or a wireless phone. Personal Communication Agents classify and act on incoming messages based on their content. A Secretary Agent routes and tailors urgent messages appropriately to the Device Manager Agent which delivers the message to a device that the user may be roaming or active on. What makes the Seamless Messaging Application unique is its approach to treating a message in a universal manner, its ability to mediate between different messaging environments and devices, and its ability to try to track and find the user.},

Particular attention should be given to the trader component and to the dynamic behaviour of the applications in response to client demand. This paper proposes a cooperative mobile agent system with a very dynamic and scalable trading service. The system is designed to allow applications to deploy servers onto the network to respond to demand making them self-configurable. Sets of simulations were performed to study the dynamic behaviour of the overall system, and identify the relevant tuning parameters.},

Configuring a device requires that a number of attributes in the network and on the device be set as well as certain software components be installed. For example, a printer requires that its drivers are present on workstations that will be using it. Currently, the manager of the network has to perform all required tasks manually. We describe four approaches that start with a procedure similar to the way plug-and-play components are handled by operating systems; e.g. Microsoft Windows. We extend the plug-and-play idea to network components. Next, we describe how this basic routine can be extended to a simple distributed model. A natural extension of the distributed model is the use of CORBA to handle a distributed environment. Finally, we propose a model of plug-and-play-ness based upon mobile agents and describe its implementation. We argue that the last approach has a number of advantages over the other models.},

The system consists of negotiating Agents: the Personal Communication Agents offers the user an intelligent interface to the service, it negotiates the best conditions in terms of quality of service and costs, the Service Provider Agent (SPA) supports the provisioning of telecommunication services to customers; the Network Provisioning Agent (NPA) provides network connectivity upon requests from the SPA. The physical setting is made up network nodes interconnected through two Public Networks; the Internet and ISDN. Network nodes are based on PCs running Windows 95 /windows NT, and Unix work stations. The system is being developed as part of the EURESCOM P712 project. The objective of the project is to assess and make recommendations on the applicability of intelligent and mobile agent technology to telecommunications service and network management. The evaluation criteria and the current status of the system are presented in the paper.},

 abstract     = {This paper illustrates a new approach to the problem of making a logical network resource configuration, adapt to customer utilisation. This is to be achieved through the use of distributed multi-agent based control techniques. The agents have goals derived from different quality metrics, which the network has to provide. In ATM networks a well designed Virtual Path Connection (VPC) overlay network tries to maximise the probability of being able to accommodate connection demand within the control plane for that particular time frame. We assume that there already exists a reasonable VPC route topology in operation. The distributed agent control architecture (Tele-MACS) describes how the coupling of planning agents with reactive agents can adapt the network resource configuration to comply with changes in user demand. The changes to the VPC route topology or capacity assignments are a requirement for the network to adapt to user behaviour and our control architecture demonstrates a mechanism for achieving the reconfigurations. The network scenario is considered a closed system, where the network operator has full control over the network elements, such as the routing tables and switching capabilities. We demonstrate our concepts with a focus on a core node ATM wide area network example, where the control system seeks to maintain network survivability and efficient use of bandwidth resources.},

In the case of (distributed) solving, MAS may lack some knowledge about the solving mechanism. Using a GA as a prototyping tool thus enables to extract heuristics for use in the MAS design. This approach, based upon a model conciliating both EA and MAS perspectives, is tested on the antenna parameter setting problem (APSP) from the field of radiomobile networks. We demonstrate the feasibility and interest of such an approach for complex problems. Moreover, we advocate the use of MAS techniques for the field of radiomobile networks.},

These agents perform monitoring and control of network and systems components, thereby supporting the integrated management of networks and services. The architecture provides transaction capabilities to control transport and mobility of agents, agent prioritization, and multiple agent code transfer schemes. Managed objects used to access resources on network elements and new system functionality can be created, distributed, and replaced dynamically. An example INCA application demonstrates that prioritized agents are necessary to support the timely execution of critical tasks. The design of our agent based network management platform is not bound to a particular programming language or computing environment; the current implementation however, is based on Java and RMI.},

 abstract     = {Orphan detection in distributed systems is a well researched field for which many solutions exist. These solutions exploit well defined parent-child relationships given in distributed systems. But they are not applicable in mobile agent systems, since no similar natural relationship between agents exist. Thus new protocols have to be developed. In this paper one such protocol for controlling mobile mobile agents and for orphan detection is presented. The `shadow' approach presented in this paper uses the idea of a placeholder (shadow) which is assigned by the agent system to each new agent. This defines an artificial relationship between agents and shadow. The shadow records the location of all dependent agents. Removing the root shadow implies that all dependent agents are declared orphan and eventually be terminated. We introduce agent proxies that create a path from shadow to every agent. In an extension of the basic protocol we additionally allow the shadow to be mobile. The shadow approach can be used for termination of groups of agents even if the exact location of each single agent is not known.},

 abstract     = {This paper considers a sequencing problem which arises naturally in the scheduling of software agents. We are given n sites at which a certain task might be successfully performed. The probability of success is $p_i$ at the ith site and these probabilities are independent. Visiting site i and trying the task there requires time (or some other cost metric) $t_i$ whether successful or not. Latencies between sites i and j are $l_ij$, that is, the travel time between those two sites. Should the task be successfully completed at a site then any remaining sites do not need to be visited. The Travelling Agent Problem is to find the sequence which minimizes the expected time to complete the task. The general formulation of this problem is NP-Complete. However, if the latencies are constant we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time by sorting the ratios $p_i/t_i$ according to decreasing value and visiting the sites in that order. This result then leads to an efficient algorithm when groups of sites form subnets in which latencies within a subnet are constant but can vary across subnets. We also study the case when there are deadlines for solving the problem in which case the goal is to maximize probability of success subject to satisfying the deadlines. Applications to mobile and intelligent agents are described.},

 abstract     = {Abstract Mobile agent technology has received a rapidly growing attention over the last few years. A number of mobile agent systems are under development in academic as well as industrial environments, there are already various moves to popularize and standardize mobile agent facilities and architectures. It has been argued that mobile agents provide certain advantages as compared to traditional approaches in terms of providing facilities like software-distribution on demand at reduced communication costs, better support for asynchronous tasks, and scalibility due to dynamic deployment which is based on a taxonomy of mobility. The employment of mobile agents has been particularly attractive in applications like information retrieval in widely distributed heterogeneous environments, network management, electronic commerce and in mobile computing. Inspite of all this growing interest and efforts the agent technology is in a fairly early stage and a number of technical problems should be solved in order to make this new technology a commercial success. These open problems include mechenisms for agent security, control structures, transactional support, and design of communication models. In this paper we extend previous research conducted on mobile agents regarding their communication performance models. It has been indicated that the optimal performance of an agent is achieved by a critical sequence of mixed remote procedure calls and agent migration. We provide here exact algorithms to solve various variants of this problem under certain restrictions on the sequence of interactions of the mobile agents.},

Odyssey is transport-independent. Whenever an agent travels from one place to another, Odyssey calls upon a transport API designed by General Magic for that purpose. Odyssey comes complete with implementations of the API for Sun's Remote Method Invocation (RMI), the OMG Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP), and Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). The RMI implementation is the default.},

This system supports call centres in making appointments with clients on the basis of knowledge of employees and their schedules. Relevant activities of employees are scheduled for employees in preparation of such appointments. The multi-agent system architecture is based on principled design, using the compositional development method for multi-agent systems DESIRE. To schedule procedures in which more than one employee is involved, each employee is represented by its own personal assistant agent, and a work manager agent co-ordinates the schedules of the personal assistant agents, and clients through the call centre. The multi-agent system architecture has been applied to the banking domain, in co-operation with and partially funded by the Rabobank.},

 abstract     = {The flexible integration of a range of disparate IT applications is a key requirement for today's global enterprises. The virtual enterprise, formed by a collection of collaborating companies for short term, high return, one off projects provides perhaps the most extreme example of this need. It is unlikely that any collaborators in a virtual enterprise will have similar networks or software, but the requirement exists for them to inter-operate. This paper proposes the notion that Mobile Agent Technology can be a significant aid to enterprise agility, particularly where distribution of information is a feature, as in virtual enterprises. The implications of using Java and its facilities for database connectivity (JDBC) together with mobile agent environments are discussed before a model to fulfil the requirements of the manufacturing Sales/Order process is proposed. The model used in the process has been produced with data collected from an industrial case study. The subsequent decomposition of the Agent types involved reveals an abstract pattern for database query using agent technology. Finally, the tools required by an enterprise wishing to utilise agent technology are discussed.},

 abstract     = {The flexible integration of a range of disparate IT applications is a key requirement for today's global enterprises. The virtual enterprise, formed by a collection of collaborating companies for short term, high return, one off projects provides perhaps the most extreme example of this need. It is unlikely that any collaborators in a virtual enterprise will have similar networks or software, but the requirement exists for them to inter-operate. This interoperation can take place over widely distributed networks that span the globe. This paper proposes the notion that agent technology, and particularly mobile agents can provide improved levels of system performance and agility, particularly where wide distribution of information is a feature, as in virtual enterprises. The implications of using Java and its facilities for database connectivity (JDBC) together with mobile agent environments are discussed before a model to fulfil the requirements of the manufacturing Sales/Order process is proposed. The model used in the process has been produced with data collected from an industrial case study. The subsequent decomposition of mobile and static agent types involved reveals the benefits of mobility in potentially improving performance, together with an abstract pattern for database query that can aid agility.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agent technology has been proposed for various application areas, including electronic commerce, systems management and active messaging. Many of these applications - in particular those for electronic commerce - require agents to be performed {\textquotedblleft}exactly once{\textquotedblright}, independent of communication and node failures. In other words, once a mobile agent has been launched, it must never be lost before its execution is finished. Moreover, each task of the agent performed at the visited nodes has to be performed exactly once. Due to the autonomy of mobile agents, there is no natural instance that monitors the progress of an agent's execution. As a result, agents may be blocked due to node crashes or network partitioning even if there are other nodes available that could continue processing. In this paper, we describe a protocol that provides the exactly-once property of agents and additionally reduces the blocking probability of agents by introducing observer nodes for monitoring the progress of agents. This protocol is based on conventional transactional technology, such as defined by X/Open DTP or CORBA OTS. It is being implemented in Mole, a mobile agent system developed at Stuttgart University.},

The architecture models the trust relations between the principals of mobile agent systems and includes authentication and authorization mechanisms.},

The idea to solve this problem is to create a blackbox out of an original agent. A blackbox is an agent that performs the same work as the original agent, but is of a different structure. This difference allows to assume a certain agent protection time interval, during which it is impossible for an attacker to discover relevant data or to manipulate the execution of the agent. After that time interval the agent and some associated data get invalid and the agent cannot migrate or interact anymore, which prevents the exploitation of attacks after the protection interval.},

A prerequisite for the use of mobile agents in a commercial environment is, that agents have to be executed reliable, independent of communication and node failure. In this paper, we first present a recently proposed fault-tolerant protocol to ensure the exactly-once execution of an agent by monitoring the agents execution. With this protocol, agents are performed in so-called stages. Each stage consists of a number of nodes. One of these nodes executes the agent while the other nodes monitor the execution. The main focus of this paper is the construction of stages. In particular, we will investigate how the number of nodes per stage influence the probability of an agent to be blocked due to failures and which nodes should be selected when forming a stage to minimize the overhead caused by the protocol. Also a flexible itinerary concept is proposed that gives agent systems the freedom to do various kinds of optimizations when determining the next node and constructing a stage.},

A prerequisite for the use of mobile agents in these environments is that agents have to be executed reliably, independent of communication and node failures. In this article, we present two approaches improving the level of fault-tolerance in agent execution. The introduction of an itinerary concept allows to specify an agent's travel plan flexibly and provides the agent system with the possibility to postpone the visit of currently unavailable nodes or to choose alternative nodes in case of node failures. The second approach is a recently proposed fault-tolerant protocol to ensure the exactly-once execution of an agent. With this protocol, agents are performed in stages. Each stage consists of a number of nodes. One of these nodes executes the agent while the others monitor the execution. After a summary of this protocol, we focus on the construction of stages.

Users of this information space do need tools for simple and powerful retrieval of the information they are interested in. But the existing search tools have turned out to be insufficient.

We present a new concept for information retrieval in the World Wide Web which satisfies both quality and efficiency. So-called domain experts acquire knowledge about specific domains. They use mobile agents to investigate the Web for documents relevant to their domain. By storing this knowledge, experts can answer future queries directly without any remote actions.},

This can be used to deal with heterogeneity and dynamicity of the information sources, as well as to ensure some degree of global data integrity.

TuCSoN exploits a notion of local tuple-based interaction space, called a tuple centre. A tuple centre is a tuple space enhanced with the capability of programming its behaviour in response to communication events. This enables properties to be embedded into the interaction space, and a mobile agent to be designed independently of the peculiarities of the information sources. Several issues critical to Internet applications can then be charged upon tuple centres transparently to agents. The effectiveness of the TuCSoN model is first shown by means of an application example in the area of Internet information retrieval, then discussed in the context of workflow management and electronic commerce.},

The paper proposes the use of distributed problem solving using mobile agents for fault finding in order to address the issues of client/server approaches to network management and control, such as scalability and the difficulties associated with maintaining an accurate view of the network. The paper uses a recently described architectural description for an agent that is biologically inspired and proposes chemical interaction as the principal mechanism for inter-swarm communication. Agents have behavior that is inspired by the foraging activities of ants, with each agent capable of simple actions; global knowledge is not assumed. The creation of chemical trails is proposed as the primary mechanism used in distributed problem solving arising from the self-organization of swarms of agents. Fault location is achieved as a consequence of agents moving through the network, sensing, acting upon sensed information, and subsequently modifying the chemical environment that they inhabit. Elements of a mobile code framework that is being used to support this research, and the mechanisms used for agent mobility within the network environment, are described.},

Two major models have been proposed for implementing mobile agent migration: one which captures the entire execution state of a running agent, and one which captures only object state. In this paper we compare the two models from the perspective of both the system programmer and the application programmer, in the context of Agent Java, a part of the D'Agents system developed at Dartmouth College. From the system programmer's perspective, we consider such issues as difficulty and complexity of implementation, while from the application programmer's perspective we examine the level of convenience, naturalness and functionality each method provides. Ideally, we would also like to compare the two methods in terms of performance, but time constraints and technical difficulties have prevented us from obtaining accurate results. Nevertheless, we present the results we were able to gather.},

In this paper, we present the TuCSoN coordination model for Internet applications based on network-aware and mobile agents, and show how the adoption of TuCSoN can positively benefit the design and development of such applications, firstly in general terms, then via a TuCSoN-coordinated sample application. This is achieved by providing for an Internet interaction space made up of a multiplicity of independently programmable communication abstractions, called tuple centres, whose behaviour can be defined so as to embody the laws of coordination.},

In this paper it is argued that the low-level infrastructure of the Web is badly suited for these new applications, as well as being somewhat inefficient in its original applications; an alternative infrastructure offering better performance and flexibility is proposed. The new infrastructure is based on the Linda coordination model, and adds a layer of abstraction over the absolute location of resources. Both theoretical and real-world issues are covered, including the problem of integrating this new system with the existing infrastructure of the Web.},

 abstract     = {Although avatars may resemble communicative interface agents, they have for the most part not profited from recent research into autonomous embodied conversational systems. In particular, even though avatars function within conversational environments (for example, chat or games), and even though they often resemble humans (with a head, hands, and a body) they are incapable of representing the kinds of knowledge that humans have about how to use the body during communication. Humans, however, do make extensive use of the visual channel for interaction management where many subtle and even involuntary cues are read from stance, gaze and gesture. We argue that the modeling and animation of such fundamental behavior is crucial for the credibility and effectiveness of the virtual interaction in chat. By treating the avatar as a communicative agent, we propose a method to automate the animation of important communicative behavior, deriving from work in conversation and discourse theory. BodyChat is a system that allows users to communicate via text while their avatars automatically animate attention, salutations, turn taking, back-channel feedback and facial expression. An evaluation shows that users found an avatar with autonomous conversational behaviors to be more natural than avatars whose behaviors they controlled, and to increase the perceived expressiveness of the conversation. Interestingly, users also felt that avatars with autonomous communicative behaviors provided a greater sense of user control.},
