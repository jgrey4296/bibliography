 abstract     = {A random method for generated binary trees is presented, ad twp forms of a class of one person games called, ''Tree Solitaire'' which have such trees as their game trees are defined. After what ''look ahead strategy'' means in terms of such games is discussed, as theorem on the most efficient use of unlimited look-ahead is proved, and a collection of strategies involving 0, 1, or 2 look-ahead per move is introduced. A method involving diagrams is presented for calculation the probability of winning under the various strategies over a restricted class of games. The superiority of one of the l look- ahead strategies over the other is proved for games of the first form on this restricted class. For games of the second form of this class, all the introduced strategies have their chances of winning calculated, and these results are compared among themselves, with the result for the first form of the game, and with the results of Monte Carlo estimation of the chance of winning in a particular case. An approximate methods for evaluating strategies form any given position is introduced, used to explain some of the previous results, and suggest modifications of strategies already defined, which are then evaluated by Monte Carlo methods. Finally, variants on Tree Solitaire are suggested, their general implications are discussed, and using the methods already developed one of the most suggestive variants is studied and the results show a significant reversal from those of the original game, which is explained by the difference in the games on one particular.},

There are two logical rules of inference: modus powers and insertion (if it is sufficient to prove B, and A is the theorem, then it is sufficient to prove A implies B). The permissible formal steps include these rules of inference as well as provision for handling definitions, lemmas, calculations, and reversion to previous states. As of now, most of the formalisms are programmed and partially debugged, but the heuristic aspects have yet to be programmed.},

Play consists of alternate turns of naming a ''test word, whose constraints are the same as ton the secret words, and the opponent answering how close the test word is to his secret word. 3.) Closeness is measured in jots; each jot is a one-to-one letter match, and independent of which word is the test word. GLASS versus SMILE or SISSY is 2 jots. 4.) The first payer to guess his opponent's secret word wins. Constraints on a JOTTO program are; First, it must have a dictionary of all possible words at the outset of each game. (The modification of adding newly experienced words to its dictionary is trivial in practice ad not worth the programming efforts, especially since one wants to avoid adding word-like typing errors, etc.) the 9unacceptable) alternative is to have a letter-deducing algorithm and then a ''word-proposer'' to order the 5 factorial = 120 combinations (perhaps based on diagram frequencies and vowel constraints) once all 5 letters are found. Second, the most use the program can make of the jots from a given test word is to eliminate from its list of ''possible secret words of opponent'' all those which do not have that number of jots against that test word. Hence, each test word should be chosen to maximize the expected information derived.},

(3) mathematical theories; This aspect is relevant not because we often need to solve specific mathematical problems but especially because we are firmly committed to maintaining a mathematical style in the laboratory. In many centers we have seen decline and deterioration following apparently successful ''experiment'' in artificial intelligence because the principles behind the performance were not understood, hence the limitations unseen.},

 abstract     = {One kind of eye movement tracking device which has great potential is the digital computer-controlled Oculometer, an instrument which non-invasively measures point of regard of the subject, as well as pupil diameter and blink occurrence. In conjunction with a computer-generated display which can change in real time as a function of the subject's eye motions, the computer- controlled Oculometer makes possible a variety of interactive measurement and control systems. Practical applications of such schemes have had to await the development of an instrument design which does not inconvenience the subject, and which conveniently interfaces with a digital computer (see ref. 1). This report describes an Oculometer subsystem and an eye-tracking/control program designed for use with the PDP-6 computer of the MIT Project MAC Artificial Intelligence Group. The oculometer electro- optic subsystem utilizes near-infrared light reflected specularly off the front surface of the subject's cornea and diffusely off the retina, producing a bright pupil with an overriding corneal highlight. An electro-optic scanning aperture vidissector within the unit, driven by a digital eye-tracking algorithm programmed into the PDP-6 computer, detects and tracks the centers of the corneal highlight and the bright pupil to give eve movement measurements. A computer-controlled, moving mirror head motion tracker directly coupled to the vidissector tracker permits the subject reasonable freedom of movement. Various applications of this system, which are suggested by the work reported here, include; (a) using the eye as a control device, (b) recording eye fixation and exploring patterns, (c) game playing, (d) training machines, and (e) psychophysiological testing and recording.},

 abstract     = {This paper was first presented at the Symposium on Complexity of Computer Computations, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York, on March 22, 1972. The equivalence problem is to determine the finest partition on a set that is consistent with a sequence of assertions of the form ''x == y''. A strategy for doing this on a computer processes the assertions serially, maintaining always in storage a representation of the partition defined by the assertions so far encountered. To process the command ''x == y'', the equivalence classes of x and y are determined. If they are the same, nothing further is done; otherwise the two classes are merged together. Galler and Fischer (1964A) give an algorithm for solving this problem based on tree structures, and it also appears in Knuth (1968A). The items in each equivalent class are arranged in a tree, and each item except for the root contains a pointer to its father. The root contains a flag indicating that it is a root, and it may also contain other information relevant to the equivalence class as a whole.},

 year         = {1972},
 institution  = {MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory},
 tags         = {__untagged},
 abstract     = {The automation of first order logic has received comparatively little attention from researcher intent upon synthesizing the theorem proving mechanism used by humans. The dominant point of view [15], [18] has been that theorem proving on the computer should be oriented to the capabilities of the computer rather than to the human mind and therefore one should not be afraid to provide the computer with a logic that humans might find strange and uncomfortable. The preeminence of this point of view is not hard to explain since until now the most successful theorem proving programs have been machine oriented. Nevertheless, there are at least two reasons for being dissatisfied with the machine oriented approach. First, a mathematician often is interested more in understanding the proof of a proposition than in being told that the propositions true, for the insight gained from an understanding of the proof can lead to the proof of additional propositions and the development of new mathematical concepts. However, machine oriented proofs can appear very unnatural to a human mathematician thereby providing him with little if any insight. Second, the machine oriented approach has failed to produce a computer program which even comes close to equaling a good human mathematician in theorem proving ability; this leads one to suspect that perhaps the logic being supplied to the machine is not as efficient as the logic used by humans. The approach taken in this paper has been to develop a theorem proving program as a vehicle for gaining a better understanding of how humans actually prove theorems. The computer program which has emerged from this study is based upon a logic which appears more ''natural'' to a human (i.e., more human oriented). While the program is not yet the equal of a top flight human mathematician, it already has given indication (evidence of which is presented in section 9) that it can outperform the best machine oriented theorem provers.},

The core of this proposal is about well-defined specific tasks such as extending the computer's ability to understand information presented as visual scenes{\textendash}or in natural, human language. Although these specific goals are important enough in themselves, we see their pursuit also as tightly bound to the development of a general theory of the computations needed to produce intelligent processes. Obviously, a certain amount of theory is needed to achieve progress in this and we maintain that the steps toward a deep theory in this domain must include thorough analysis of a very specific phenomena. Our confidence in this strategy is based both on past successes and on our current theory of knowledge structure. These bases are discussed both below and in the appendices.},

When FORTRAN was invented, it was touted as an automatic programmer, and indeed it was, as it relieved the user of complete specification of the details of implementation. Newer programming languages are just elaborations (usually better) of that basic idea. I am, however, interested in the problem of implementation of a partially specified algorithm rather tan a complete algorithm and a partially specified implementation. This problem is truly in the domain of Artificial Intelligence because the system which ''solves'' this problem needs a great deal of knowledge about the problem domain for which te algorithm is being constructed in order to ''reasonably'' complete the specification. Indeed, a programmer is not told exactly the algorithm to be implemented, he is told the problem which his program is expected to solve.},

This paper considers differential perceptions, which view a continuous retina. Thus, instead of summing the results of predicates, we must now integrate. This involves setting up a predicate space which transforms the typical perceptron sum, Ea(p)a(f), into Esacp,f(p)dp, where f is the figure on the retina, i.e. in the differential case, the figure is viewed as a function on the predicate space. We show that differential perceptrons are equivalent to perceptrons on the class of figures that fit exactly onto a sufficiently small square grid. By investigating predicates of various geometric transformations, we discover that translation and symmetry can be computed in finite order using finite coefficients in both continuous and discrete cases. We also note that in the perceptron scheme, combining data linearly implies the ability to combine data in a polynomial fashion.},

The program employs a combination of forward and backward chaining with the forward component playing the more important role. This, together with a deeper use of diagrammatic information, allows the program to dispense with the diagram filter in contrast with its central role in previous programs.

 abstract     = {The rate of convergence of infinite series can be accelerated b y a suitable splitting of each term into two parts and then combining the second part of the n-th term with the first part of the (n+1) -th term t get a new series and leaving the first part of the first term as an ''orphan''. Repeating this process an infinite number of times, the series will often approach zero, and we obtain the series of orphans, which may converge faster than the original series. H euristics for determining the splits are given. Various mathematical constants, originally defined as series having a term ratio which approaches 1, are accelerated into series having a term ratio less than 1. This is done with the constants of Euler and Catalan. The se ries for pi/4 = arctan 1 is transformed into a variety of series, among which is one having a term ration of 1/27 and another having a term ratio of 54/3125. A series for 1/pi is found which has a term ratio of 1/64 and each term of which is an integer divided by a powe r of 2, thus making it easy to evaluate the sum in binary arithmetic. We express zeta(3) in terms of pi-3 and a series having a term ra tio of 1/16. Various hypergeometric function identities are found, as well as a series for (arcsin y)-2 curiously related to a series f or y arcsin y. Convergence can also be accelerated for finite sums, as is shown for the harmonic numbers. The sum of the reciprocals of the Fibonacci numbers has been expressed as a series having the convergence rate of theta function. Finally, it is shown that a series whose n-th term ratio is (n+p)(n+q)/(n+r)(n+s), where p, q, r, s are integers, is equal to c + d pi-2, where c and d are rational.},

 abstract     = {This is a partial theory of thinking, combining a number of classical and modern concepts from psychology, linguistics, and AI. Whenever one encounters a new situation (or makes a substantial change in one's viewpoint) he selects from memory a structure called a frame, a remembered framework to be adopted to fit reality by changing details as necessary. A frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotyped situation, like being in a certain kind of living room, or going to a child's birthday party. Attached to each frame are several kinds of information. Some of this information is about how to use the frame. Some is about what one can expect to happen next. Some is about what to do if these expectations are not confirmed. The ''top levels'' of a frame are fixed, and represent things that are always true about the supposed situation. The lower levels have many ''alota'' that must be filled by specific instances or data. Collections of related frames are linked together into frame- systems. The effects of important actions are mirrored by transformations between the frames of a system. These are used to make certain kinds of calculations economical, to represent changes of emphasis and attention and to account for effectiveness of ''imagery''. In Vision, the different frames of a system describe the scene from different viewpoints, and the transformations between one frame and another represent the effects of moving from place to place. Other kinds of frame- systems can represent actions, cause-effect relations, or changes in conceptual viewpoint. The paper applies the frame-system idea also to problems of linguistic understanding: memory, acquisition and retrieval of knowledge, and a variety of ways to reason by analogy and jump to conclusions based on partial similarity matching.},

Theories of computability have been based on Turing machines, recursive factions of integers and computer programs. Each of these has artificialities which make it difficult to manipulate algorithms or to prove things about them. The present paper presents a formalism based on conditional forms and recursive functions whereby the functions computable in terms of certain base functions can be simply expressed. We also describe some of the formal properties of conditional forms and a method called recursion induction for proving facts about algorithms.

EL`s reasoning is based on the concept of a ''local one-step deduction'' augmented by various ''teleological'' principles and by the concept of a ''macro-element''. We present several annotated examples of EL in operation and an explanation of how it works. We also show how EL can be extended in several directions, including sinusoidal steady state analysis. Finally, we touch on possible implications for engineering education. We feel that EL is significant not only as a novel approach to circuit analysis but also as an application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to a new and interesting domain.},

The description must minimally include syntactic information reminiscent of data structure declarations in more conventional programming languages, and can be extended by the user. Two reasons for such systems are seen: (1) As A.I. programs develop from toy domains using toy data bases, to more realistic exercises, the management of the knowledge base becomes non-trivial and requires program support. (2) A powerful way to organize LISP programs is to make them data-driven, whereby pieces of program are distributed throughout a data base. A data base management system facilitates the use of this programming style. The paper describes and discusses the basic ideas in the DABA system as well as the technique of data driven programs.},

If we wish to have a theory about how LISP really works, then it is necessary to have a version of eval which is satisfactory both theoretically and practically. I will propose a definition for eval, and then illustrate how this eval differs from the existing system and RFSE definitions by means of examples.},

Representations for local and global spatial knowledge are discussed in detail. The model is compared with a survey of the psychological literature.

The solution that has become conventional in modern mathematics is based on the notion of ''random variable'', a highly technical notion in which the basic process is represented as a certain kind of infinite function-space. This space contains all possible observed behavior sequences together with a ''measure'' structure which enables one to calculate the relative frequency of certain (''measurable'') complex events.

 abstract     = {Until recently, most computer graphics systems have been oriented toward the display of line drawins, continually refreshing the screen from a display list of vectors. Developments such as plasma panel displays and rapidly declining memory prices have now made feasible raster graphics systems, which instead associate some memory with each point on the screen, and display points according to the contents of the memory. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of such systems. Raster systems permit operations which are not feasible on vector displays, such as reading directly from the screen as well as writing it, and manipulating two dimensional areas as well as vectors. Conceptual differences between programming for raster and vector systems are illustrated with a description of the author`s TV Turtle, a graphics system for raster scan video display terminals. This system is embedded in Logo, a Lisp-like interactive programming language designed for use by kids, and is based on Logo`s turtle geometry approach to graphics. Logo provides powerful ideas for using graphics which are easy for kids to learn, yet generalize naturally when advanced capabilities such as primitives for animation and color are added to the system.},

 abstract     = {Almost nothing can be deduced about a general 3-D surface given only its occluding contours in an image, yet contour information is easily and effectively used by us to infer the shape of a surface. Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface {\textendash} i.e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods, together with the algorithms for implementing them devised by Vatan     Marr (1977), provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr and Nishihara (1977).},

By thus balancing scope of description against detail, the complexity of the computations needed to support the representation is minimized. The method requires (a) a database of stored stick figures; (b) a simple device called the image-space processor for moving between object- centered and viewer-centered coordinate frames; and (c) a process for ''relaxing'' a stored model onto the image during recognition. The relation of the theory to ''mental rotation'' phenomena is discussed, and some critical experimental predictions are made.},

This view, combined with the view of function invocation as a kind of generalized GOTO, leads to several new insights into the nat ure of the LISP evaluation mechanism and the symmetry between form and function, evaluation and application, and control and environmen t. It also complements Hewitt's actors theory nicely, explaining the intent of environment manipulation as cleanly, generally, and intu itively as the actors theory explains control structures. The relationship between functional and continuation-passing styles of progra mming is also clarified. This view of LAMBDA leads directly to a number of specific techniques for use by an optimizing compiler: 1.) T emporary locations and user-declared variables may be allocated in a uniform manner. 2.) Procedurally defined data structures may compi le into code as good as would be expected for data defined by the more usual declarative means. 3.) Lambda-calculus-theoretic models of such constructs as GOT, DO loops, call-by-name, etc. may be used directly as macros, the expansion of which may then compile into code as good as that produced by compilers which are designed especially to handle GOTO, DO, etc. The necessary characteristics of such a c ompiler designed according to this philosophy are discussed. Such a compiler is to be built in the near future as a testing ground for these ideas.},

We call this style of circuit analysis propagation of constraints. The system threads deduced facts with justifications which mention the antecedent facts and the rule used. These justifications may be examined by the user to gain insight into the operation of the set of rules as they apply to a problem. The same justifications are used by the system to determine the currently active data-base context for reasoning in hypothetical situations. They are also used by the system in the analysis failures to reduce the search space. This leads to effective control of cominatorial search which we call dependency-directed backtracking.},

Subjects accepted previously seen strings most frequently, following by translations, with New strings accepted least often. This replicateds Rosenberg and Simon`s (in press) findings with sentences and pictures that express the same concept. However, in the present experiment the two forms of a string were unbiased with respect to verbal or pictorial encoding. The forms in which a string could appear (upper or lower case) were not confounded with the two types of encoding (verbal and pictorial) hypothesized by a dual coding theory. The results supported the view that the previously reported difference between the original form and a translation is best explained by a model which uses a single representation that preserves some form distinctions.},

 abstract     = {A Moire-like effect can be observed in dot patterns consisting of two superimposed copies of a random dot pattern where one copy has been expanded, translated, or rotated. One perceives in these patterns a structure that is locally parallel. Our ability to perceive this structure is shown by experiment to be limited by the local geometry of the pattern, independent of the overall structure or the dot density. A simple representation of locally parallel structure is proposed, and it is found to be computable by a non-iterative, parallel algorithm. An implementation of this algorithm is demonstrated. Its performance parallels that observed experimentally, providing a potential explanation for human performance. Advantages are discussed for the early description of locally parallel structure in the course of visual processing.},

In particular, the paper focuses on the troubleshooting of electronic circuits. Only the individual properties of the components are used, and not the collective properties of groups of components. The concept of propagation is introduced which uses the voltage-current properties of components to determing additional information from given measurements. Two propagated values can be discovered for the same point. This is called a coincidence. In a faulted circuit, the assumptions made about components in the coinciding propagations can then be used to determine information about the faultiness of these components. In order for the program to deal with actual circuits, it handles errors in measurement readings and tolerances in component parameters. This is done by propagating ranges of numbers instead of single numbers. Unfortunately, the comparing of ranges introduces many complexities into the theory of coincidences. In conclusion, we show how such local deductions can be used as the basis for qualitative reasoning and troubleshooting.},

We focus on what we feel is a sensible next step, the problem of automating aspects of control. To accomplish this we propose a definition of control based on a fact/ heuristic dichotomy, a variation of Chomsky's competence/performance dichotomy. The dichotomy formalizes an idea originating with McCarthy and developed by Green, Hewitt, McDermott, Sussman, Hayes, Kowalski and others. It allows one to operate arbitrarily on the control component of a program without affecting the program's correctness, which is entirely the responsibility of the fact component. The immediate objectives of our research are to learn how to program keeping fact and control separate, and to identify those aspects of control amenable to automation.},

An important aspect of vision is the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. In the early stages of the analysis of an image, the representations used depend more on what it is possible to compute from an image than on what is ultimately desirable, but later representations can be more sensitive to the specific needs of recognition. This essay surveys recent work in vision at M.I.T. from a perspective in which the representational problems assume a primary importance. An overall framework is suggested for visual information processing, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations; (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centered representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces, and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object- centered description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. Recent results concerning processes for constructing and maintaining these representations are summarized and discussed.},

 abstract     = {Wusor II is the second program that has been developed to tutor students in the game of Wumpus. From the earlier efforts with Wusor I it was possible to produce a rule-based expert which processed a relatively complete mastery of the game. Wusor II endeavors to teach the knowledge embodied in the rules used by the Expert. The Student Model represents Wusor`s estimation of the student`s knowledge of said rules, and this estimation is based primarily on analyses of the player`s moves. The Student Model allows Wusor to personalize its explanations to the student according to the student`s current knowledge of the game. The result is a system which, according to preliminary results, is highly effective at tutoring students of varied abilities.},

This memo presents COMEX-), a prototype system written in FRL, a frame-based language (Goldstein     Roberts, 1977). COMEX-O has a complaint handling system, frame structure matching and simple reasoning. By conversing with a user, it builds groupings of frame structures to represent events. These are called CLUSTERS and are proposed as a new representation method. New CLUSTERS are built from previously defined ones using INSTANTIATION and AGGREGATION, two methods which combine with frame inheritance and constraints to make up a general event representation mechanism. CLUSTERS capture the idea of generic patterns of relationships between frames and raise an issue named the GENERIC CONSTRAINT PROBLEM concerning constraints between the parts of a cluster. The final section presents plans for future work on qualitative reasoning within COMEX and includes a hypothetical scenario.},

It is proved that for this actuator a bang-coast-bang actuation pattern minimizes the energy expenditure. For some parameter values this pattern is modified by a singular arc at the first switching point. A surprising limitation on the duration of coast is demonstrated. Some relaxations of the restrictions underlying the spring model are shown to preserve the bang-coast-bang solution.},

The process of localization and removal of bugs called for by the PSBDARP theory requires an approach to engineering analysis in which every result has a justification which describes the exact set of assumptions it depends upon. We have developed a program based on Analysis by Propagation of Constraints which can explain the basis of its deductions. In addition to being useful to a PSBDARP designer, these justifications are used in Dependency- Directed Backtracking to limit the combinatorial search in the analysis routines. Although the research we will describe is explicitly about electrical circuits, we believe that similar principles and methods are employed by other kinds of engineers, including computer programmers.},

The historical growth of this myth is considered. Both theoretical ideas and an existing implementation are discussed which debunk this myth. It is shown that the unrestricted use of procedure calls permits great stylistic freedom. In particular, any flowchart can be written as a 'structured' program without introducing extra variables. The difficulty with the GOTO statement and the procedure call is characterized as a conflict between abstract programming concepts and concrete language constructs.},

The resulting algorithms use a general linear operator, the kernel of which depends on the details of the scanning geometry. Here this method is applied to the problem of reconstructing density distributions from arbitrary fan-beam data. The general fan-beam method is then specialized to a number of scanning geometries of practical importance. Included are two cases where the kernel of the general linear operator can be factored and rewritten as a function of the difference of coordinates only and the superposition integral consequently simplifies into a convolution integral. Algorithms for these special cases of the fan-beam problem have been developed previously by others. In the general case, however, Fourier transforms and convolutions do not apply, and linear space-variant operators must be used. As a demonstration, details of a fan-beam method for data obtained with uniform ray-sampling density are developed.},

Zero-crossings of the mask values are localized, and positions that correspond to terminations are found. 3.) For each mask size, matching takes place between pairs of zero crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. 4.) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. 5.) When a correspondence is achieved, it is written into a dynamic buffer, called the 2-1/2-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum's area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the fusion process.},

It differs from most current dialects of LISP in that it closes all lambda-expressions in the environment of their definition or declaration, rather than in the execution environment. This has the consequence that variables are normally lexically scoped, as in ALGOL. However, in contrast with ALGOL, SCHEME treats procedures as a first-class data type. They can be the values of variables, the returned values of procedures, and components of data structures. Another difference from LISP is that SCHEME is implemented in such a way that tail- recursions execute without net growth of the interpreter stack. The effect of this is that a procedure call behaves like a GOTO and thus procedure calls can be used to implement iterations, as in PLASMA.},

We explore the consequences of various variable binding disciplines and the introduction of side effects. We find that dynamic scoping is unsuitable for constructing procedural abstractions, but has another role as agent of modularity, being a structured form of side effect. More general side effects are also found to be necessary to promote modular style. We find that the notion of side effect and the notion of equality (object identity) are mutually constraining; to define one is to define the other. The interpreters we exhibit are all written in a simple dialect of LISP, and all implement LISP-like languages. A subset of these interpreters constitute a partial historical reconstruction of the actual evaluation of LISP.},

 abstract     = {This paper investigates some problems associated with an expression evaluation order that we call ''future'' order, which is different from call-by-name, call-by-value, and call-by-need. In future order evaluation, an object called ''future'' is created to serve as the value of each expression that is to be evaluated and separate process is dedicated to its evaluation. This mechanism allows the fully parallel evaluation of the expressions in a programming language. We discuss an approach to a problem that arises in this context: futures which were thought to be relevant when they were created become irrelevant through not being needed later in computation. The problem of irrelevant processes also appears in multiprocessing problem-solving systems which start several processors working on the same problem but with different methods, and return with the solution which finishes first. This parallel method strategy has the drawback that the processes which are investigating the losing methods must be identified, cleanly stopped, and the processors they are using reassigned to more useful tasks. The solution we propose is that of incremental garbage collection. The goal structure of the solution plan should be explicitly represented in memory as part of the graph memory (like Lisp's heap) so that a garbage collection algorithm can discover which processes are performing useful work, and which can be recycled for a new task. An incremental algorithm for the unified garbage collection of storage and processes is described.},

This lies in the fact that even quite rudimentary languages are nevertheless ''universal'' in the following sense. If the language allows us to program with simple arithmetic or list processing functions, then any effective control structure can be simulated, traditionally by encoding a Turing machine computation in some way. In particular, a simple language with some basic arithmetic can express programs for any partial recursive function. Such an encoding is usually quite unnatural and impossibly inefficient. Thus in order to carry on a practical study of the comparative power of different languages we are led to banish explicit functions and deal instead with abstract, uninterpreted programs, or schemas.

We develop here an affine transformation between coordinates of Multi- Spectral Scanner (MSS) images produced by the LANDSAT satellites, and coordinates of a system lying in a plane tangent to the earth`s surface near the sub-satellite (Nadir) point.},

 abstract     = {How is semantic information from different modalities integrated and stored? If related ideas are encountered in French and English, or in pictures and sentences, is the result a single representation in memory or two modality-dependent ones? Subjects were presented with items in different modalities, then were asked whether or not subsequently presented items were identical with the former ones. Subjects frequently accepted translations and items semantically consistent with those presented earlier as identical, although not as often as they accepted items actually seen previously. The same pattern of results was found when the items were French and English sentences, and when they were pictures and sentences. The results can be explained by the hypothesis that subjects integrate information across modalities into a single underlying semantic representation. A computer model, embodying this hypothesis, made predictions in close agreement with the data.},

PAL is being designed to arrange various kinds of events with concern for the who, what, when, where and why of that event. The goal for PAL is to permit a speaker to interact with it in English and to use extended discourse to state the speaker`s requirements. The portion of the language system discussed in this report disambiguates references from discourse and interprets the purpose of sentences of the discourse. PAL uses the focus of discourse to direct its attention to a portion of the discourse and to the database to which the discourse refers. The focus makes it possible to disambiguate references with minimal search. Focus and a frames representation of the discourse make it possible to interpret discourse purposes. The focus and representation of the discourse are explained, and the computational components of PAL which implement reference disambiguation and discourse interpretation are presented in detail.},

The relations among beliefs can also be used to directly trace the source of contradictions or failures, resulting in far more efficient backtracking.},

 abstract     = {Most real world domains differ from the micro- worlds traditionally used in A.I. in that they have an incomplete factual database which changes over time. Understanding in these domains can be thought of as the generation of plausible inferences which are able to use the facts available, and respond to changes in them. A traditional rule interpreter such as Planner can be extended to construct plausible inferences in these domains by A) allowing assumptions to be made in applying rules, resulting in simplifications of rules which can be used in an incomplete database; B) monitoring the antecedents and consequents of a rule so that inferences can be maintained over a changing database. The resulting chains of inference can provide a dynamic description of an event. This allows general reasoning processes to be used to understand in domains for which large numbers of Schema-like templates have been proposed as the best model.},

Using a combination of observations made of the students, representations drawn by the students and protocols kept by the computer of each session, it was found that the synthetic students are a reasonable static model of real students, but miss completely many of the important dynamic factors which affect a student`s play. In spite of this, the Wumpus game was found to be an effective educational tool.},

 abstract     = {Traditional stereo techniques determine range by relating two images of an object viewed from different directions. If the correspondence between picture elements is known, then distance to the object can be calculated by triangulation. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine this correspondence. This paper introduces a novel technique called photometric stereo. The idea of photometric stereo is to vary the direction of the incident illumination between successive views while holding the viewing direction constant. This provides enough information to determine surface orientation at each picture element. Since the imaging geometry does not change, the correspondence between picture elements is known a priori. This stereo technique is photometric because it uses the intensity values recorded in a single picture element, in successive views, rather than the relative positions of features.},
