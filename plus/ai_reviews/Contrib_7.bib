The study consisted of 16 pilots flying a series of instrument approaches in a cockpit simulator. Performance data, subjective workload, situational awareness and acceptability ratings were collected. The results showed that the APES reduced pilot workload, increased situational awareness, and improved flight performance compared to flying approaches without the decision aid. Refinements to the APES algorithm and pilot-vehicle interface were indicated. Implications for further research are discussed.},

 abstract     = {This paper studies properties of a multi-swarm system based on a concept of physical quantum particles (mQSO). Quantum particles differ from the classic ones in the way they move. As opposed to the classic view of particle movement, where motion is controlled by linear kinematic laws, quantum particles change their location according to random distributions. The procedure for generating a new location for the quantum particle is similar to mutation operators widely used in evolutionary computation with real-valued representation. In this paper we study a set of new distributions of candidates for quantum particle location, and we show different features of these distributions. The distributions considered in this paper are divided into two classes: those with a limited range of the new location coordinates and those without such limitations. They are tested on different types of dynamic optimization problems. Experimental verification has been based on a number of testing environments and two main versions of the algorithm: with and without mechanisms protecting against stagnation caused by convergence of sub-swarms during the search process. The experimental results show the advantages of the distribution class, in which the candidates are spread out in the entire search space, and indicate the positive and negative aspects of application of anti-convergence mechanisms.},

 abstract     = {Since practical problems often are very complex with a large number of objectives it can be difficult or impossible to create an objective function expressing all the criterias of good solutions. Sometimes a simpler function can be used where local optimas could be both valid and interesting. Because evolutionary algorithms are population-based they have the best potential for finding more of the best solutions among the possible solutions. However, standard EAs often converge to one solution and leave therefore only this single option for a final human selection. So far at least two methods, sharing and tagging, have been proposed to solve the problem. This paper presents a new method for finding more quality solutions, not only global optimas but local as well. The method tries to adapt it's search strategy to the problem by taking the topology of the fitness landscape into account. The idea is to use the topology of the fitness landscape to group the individuals into sub-populations each covering a part of the fitness landscape.},

 In this paper we present an approach to automated program code generation for sensor nodes and other small devices using Genetic Programming. We give a short introduction to Genetic Algorithms. Our new Distributed Genetic Programming Framework facilitates the development of sensor network applications. Genetic evolution of programs requires program testing. Therefore we use a simulation environment for distributed systems of sensor nodes. The simulation model takes into account characteristic features of sensor nodes, such as unreliable communication and resource constraints. Two application examples are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and its potential to create robust and adaptive code for sensor network applications.},

 abstract     = {Distributed systems are one of the most vital components of the economy. The most prominent example is probably the internet, a constituent element of our knowledge society. During the recent years, the number of novel network types has steadily increased. Amongst others, sensor networks, distributed systems composed of tiny computational devices with scarce resources, have emerged. The further development and heterogeneous connection of such systems imposes new requirements on the software development process. Mobile and wireless networks, for instance, have to organize themselves autonomously and must be able to react to changes in the environment and to failing nodes alike. Researching new approaches for the design of distributed algorithms may lead to methods with which these requirements can be met efficiently. In this thesis, one such method is developed, tested, and discussed in respect of its practical utility.
 Our new design approach for distributed algorithms is based on Genetic Programming, a member of the family of evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms are metaheuristic optimization methods which copy principles from natural evolution. They use a population of solution candidates which they try to refine step by step in order to attain optimal values for predefined objective functions.
 The synthesis of an algorithm with our approach starts with an analysis step in which the wanted global behavior of the distributed system is specified. From this specification, objective functions are derived which steer a Genetic Programming process where the solution candidates are distributed programs. The objective functions rate how close these programs approximate the goal behavior in multiple randomized network simulations. The evolutionary process step by step selects the most promising solution candidates and modifies and combines them with mutation and crossover operators. This way, a description of the global behavior of a distributed system is translated automatically to programs which, if executed locally on the nodes of the system, exhibit this behavior.
 In our work, we test six different ways for representing distributed programs, comprising adaptations and extensions of well-known Genetic Programming methods (SGP, eSGP, and LGP), one bio-inspired approach (Fraglets), and two new program representations called Rule-based Genetic Programming (RBGP, eRBGP) designed by us. We breed programs in these representations for three well-known example problems in distributed systems: election algorithms, the distributed mutual exclusion at a critical section, and the distributed computation of the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers.
 Synthesizing distributed programs the evolutionary way does not necessarily lead to the envisaged results. In a detailed analysis, we discuss the problematic features which make this form of Genetic Programming particularly hard. The two Rule-based Genetic Programming approaches have been developed especially in order to mitigate these difficulties. In our experiments, at least one of them (eRBGP) turned out to be a very efficient approach and in most cases, was superior to the other representations.},

The task is defined in a form of a composition request which contains a set of available input parameters and a set of wanted output parameters. Instead of the parameter values, concepts from an ontology describing their semantics are passed to the composition engine. The parameters of the services in the repository the composer works on are semantically annotated in the same way as the parameters in the request. The composer then finds a sequence of services, called a composition. If the input parameters given in the request are provided, the services of this sequence can subsequently be executed and will finally produce the wanted output parameters.

 In this paper, three different approaches to semantic web service composition are formally defined and compared with each other: an uninformed search in form of an IDDFS algorithm, a greedy informed search based on heuristic functions, and a multi-objective genetic algorithm.},

These international contests are focused on semantic web service composition. In each challenge of the contests, a repository of web services is given. The input and output parameters of the services in the repository are annotated with semantic concepts. A query to a semantic composition engine contains a set of available input concepts and a set of wanted output concepts. In order to employ an offered service for a requested role, the concepts of the input parameters of the offered operations must be more general than requested (contravariance). In contrast, the concepts of the output parameters of the offered service must be more specific than requested (covariance). The engine should respond to a query by providing a valid composition as fast as possible. We discuss three different methods for web service composition: an uninformed search in form of an IDDFS algorithm, a greedy informed search based on heuristic functions, and a multi-objective genetic algorithm.},

 abstract     = {The ubiquitous presence of distributed systems has drastically changed the way the world interacts, and impacted not only the economics and governance but also the society at large. It is therefore important for the architecture and infrastructure within the distributed environment to be continuously renewed in order to cope with the rapid changes driven by the innovative technologies. However, many problems in distributed computing are either of dynamic nature, large scale, NP complete, or a combination of any of these. In most cases, exact solutions are hardly found. As a result, a number of intelligent nature-inspired algorithms have been used recently, as these algorithms are capable of achieving good quality solutions in reasonable computational time. Among all the nature-inspired algorithms, evolutionary algorithms are considerably the most extensively applied ones. This chapter presents a systematic review of evolutionary algorithms employed to solve various problems related to distributed systems. The review is aimed at providing an insight of evolutionary approaches, in particular genetic algorithms and genetic programming, in solving problems in five different areas of network optimization: network topology, routing, protocol synthesis, network security, and parameter settings and configuration. Some interesting applications from these areas will be discussed in detail with the use of illustrative examples.},

 institution  = {Institute of Computing Science, Poznan University of Technology},
 tags         = {__untagged},
 abstract     = {Genetic Programming (GP) is a most popular approach to automatic generation of computer programs. Standard methods applied in GP use raw fragments of evolved programs to construct new, hopefully better ones. These methods, except the selection phase, passover the behavior of the modified programs and operate mainly on their syntax. In this dissertation we follow alternative, semantic-oriented approach that concentrates on the actual behavior of programs in population to determine how to construct the new ones. This research trend grew up as an attempt to overcome weaknesses of methods that rely only on syntax analysis. Recent contributions suggest that semantic extensions to GP can be a remedy to poor performance of classical, syntactic methods. Therefore, in this dissertation we firstly present the advantages and disadvantages of several possible descriptions of program�s behavior. Then we introduce the concept of semantics used in all semantic extensions presented throughout this thesis. The first semantic extension presented in this thesis is a method population initialization which forces the individuals in population to be semantically unique. We also show selected semantic-aware variants of crossover and mutation operators. In particular, we test how they perform with and without our initialization method. Next, we introduce and formalize our novel concept of desired semantics that describes the desired behavior for given part of a program. Then we propose several methods that employ desired semantics to create new programs by combining matching parts. We show that some of these methods significantly outperform other methods, semantic as well as syntactic ones. The second important proposition of this thesis is the concept of functional modularity. Functional modularity involves defining modules based on their semantic properties instead of syntactical ones, like, e.g., the frequency of occurring some code fragments. Functional modularity can be used to decompose a problem into potentially easier parts (subproblems), and then to solve the subproblems in isolation or together. All the described methods are illustrated with extensive experimental verification of their performance on a carefully prepared benchmark suite that contains problems from various domains. On this suite, we show the overall advantage of semantic-aware extensions, especially for methods that rely on desired semantics.},

 abstract     = {Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) is an important and difficult optimization problem in power system planning. This article aims at addressing two practically important issues related to ELD optimization: (1) analyzing the ELD problem from the perspective of evolutionary optimization; (2) developing effective algorithms for ELD problems of large scale. The first issue is addressed by investigating the fitness landscape of ELD problems with the purpose of estimating the expected performance of different approaches. To address the second issue, a new algorithm named {\textquotedblleft}Estimation of Distribution and Differential Evolution Cooperation{\textquotedblright} (ED-DE) is proposed, which is a serial hybrid of two effective evolutionary computation (EC) techniques: estimation of distribution and differential evolution. The advantages of ED-DE over the previous ELD optimization algorithms are experimentally testified on ELD problems with the number of generators scaling from 10 to 160. The best solution records of classical 13 and 40-generator ELD problems with valve points, and the best solution records of 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160-generator ELD problems with both valve points and multiple fuels are updated in this work. To further evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of ED-DE, we also compare it with other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) on typical function optimization tasks.},

One of its distinctive features is that it strives to perform natural induction, that is, it seeks inductive hypotheses that are not only accurate but also easy to understand and interpret. Although the system provides the user with a large number of control parameters, they all can be omitted if one wants to run it in default mode. The parameters control the mode of learning (theory formation vs. pattern discovery), the degree of generality of learned rules, and a range of preference criteria for selecting candidate rules that tailor the learning process to the given problem. AQ21 includes event and episode classification programs (ATEST and EPIC) that give the user control over the testing and application of the learned rulesets to the task at hand.},

LEM3 supports different attribute types for describing individuals in the population, such as nominal, rank, structured, interval and ratio, which makes it applicable to a wide range of practical problems. It also implements very efficient methods for switching between different modes of operation and operators controlling the generation of new individuals. This paper describes the underlying LEM3 algorithm, results from LEM3 testing on selected benchmark function optimization problems (with the number of variables varying from 10 to 1000), and its comparison with EA, a conventional, Darwinian-type evolutionary computation program. In every experiment, without exception, LEM3 outperformed EA in terms of the evolution length (the number of fitness evaluations needed to achieved a desired solution), sometimes very significantly. It also outperformed the previous LEM2 implementation.},

Because of the latter feature it is called a natural induction program. This feature is achieved by employing a highly expressive representation language, Attributional Calculus, that combines aspects of propositional, predicate and multi-valued logic for the purpose of supporting pattern discovery and inductive learning. This paper briefly describes the pattern discovery mode in AQ21, and several novel abilities seamlessly integrated in it, specifically, to discover different types of attributional patterns depending on the parameter settings, to optimize patterns according to a large number of different pattern quality criteria, to learn rules with exceptions, to determine optimized sets of alternative hypotheses generalizing the same data, and to handle data with missing, irrelevant and/or not-applicable meta-values. The discovered patterns are expressed in the form of attributional rules that are directly interpretable in natural language and are visualized using either general logic diagrams or concept association graphs. The described program features are illustrated by a sample of pattern discovery problems.},

An extension to GP is the ability to define modules, which are in turn tree based representations defined in terms of the primitives. The most well known of these methods is Koza's Automatically Defined Functions. In this paper it is proved that for a given problem, the minimum number of nodes in the main tree plus the nodes in any modules is independent of the primitive set (up to an additive constant) and depends only on the function being expressed. This reduces the number of user defined parameters in the run and makes the inclusion of a hypothesis in the search space independent of the primitive set.},

 abstract     = {Standard GP, chiefly concerned with evolving functions which are mappings from inputs to output, is not Turing Complete. This paper raises issues resulting from attempts at extending standard GP to Turing Complete representations. Firstly, there is a problem when a contiguous piece of code is moved to a new location (in a different program) by crossover. In general its functionality will be altered if global memory is used, as other parts of the program may access the same piece of memory. Secondly, traditional crossover does not respect modules. Crossover can disrupt a group of instructions that were working together (e.g. in the body of a loop) in one parent, but end up separated in two different offspring after reproduction. A crossover operator is proposed that only operates at the boundaries of modules. The identification of module boundaries is made easy by using a representation in which explicit modules are defined, in contrast with other representations where the module boundaries would have to be identified by some other means. The halting problem is a central issue, however as a consequence of this crossover operator we are more likely to produce self terminating programs, thus saving time when testing.},

 abstract     = {Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Genetic Programming (GP) are often considered as separate but related fields. Typically, GAs use a fixed length linear representation, whereas GP uses a variable size tree representation. This paper argues that the differences are unimportant. Firstly, variable length actually means variable length up to some fixed limit, so can really be considered as fixed length. Secondly, the representations and genetic operators of GA and GP appear different, however ultimately it is a population of bit strings in the computers memory which is being manipulated whether it is GA or GP which is being run on the computer. The important difference lies in the interpretation of the representation; if there is a one to one mapping between the description of an object and the object itself (as is the case with the representation of numbers), or a many to one mapping (as is the case with the representation of programs). This has ramifications for the validity of the No Free Lunch theorem, which is valid in the first case but not in the second. It is argued that due to the highly related nature of GAs and GP, that many of the empirical results discovered in one field will apply to the other field, for example maintaining high diversity in a population to improve performance.},

 abstract     = {We are concerned with the induction of a rule from a set of observations, the goal being to succinctly describe the observed data, but more importantly to place us in a position to make predictions about future data which we have not previously seen. One approach to rule induction is to form a hypothesis space which consists of potential rules or hypotheses, and then search this space for a rule which is consistent with the observed data. One formulation of this approach is Genetic Programming, where the hypothesis spaces consists of computer programs and the search of this space is conducted using biologically inspired search operators and a fitness function. The well known No Free Lunch theorems are central to search and essentially says all search algorithms perform equally, under a number of assumptions. We examine these assumptions and show that they are invalidated when the hypothesis space contains hypotheses which represent functions with different frequencies, as is the case with Genetic Programming and a number of other Machine Learning paradigms. The Conservation of Generalisation, which is related to the No Free Lunch theorems, implies that generalisation is impossible. This is contrary to Occam's razor. The Conservation of Generalisation theorems and Occam's razor are consistent if we restrict ourselves to representations which do not compress the observed data. We define the representational complexity of a function to be the minimum size of a given representation which can express the function. Given a primitive set, and the operation of composition, new functions can be constructed, which is the representation standard Genetic Programming uses to express functions. However the complexity of a function under this type of representation will depend on the primitive set. We prove that if a representation is capable of expressing modules (i.e. reuse of component parts of the representation), then the complexity of a function is independent of the primitive set (up to a constant which depends on the primitive set but not on the function being represented). We then conduct a number of experiments related to the evolution of Turing Complete representations. We argue that, if a representation can address the general case of a variable sized problem then the average number of evaluations to find a solution is independent of the problem size. In Genetic Programming, a fitness function is used to drive the evolutionary process and promote programs which are more likely to lead to solutions. We experiment with a fitness function which includes information about whether or not a program had to be aborted during it's evaluation and demonstrate that a 10 fold reduction in the number of evaluations can be achieved on an arithmetic problem. Finally, we experiment with a crossover operator which is inspired by the theory of recursive functions and reduced the probability of producing a program which has to be terminated during its evaluation.},

This system utilizes anevolutionary algorithm with intelligent search operations in order to achieve a high utilization of resources and a minimization of the distance travelled by freight carriers in real-world scenarios. We test our planner rigorously with real-world data and obtain substantial improvements when compared to the original freight plans. Additionally, different settings for the evolutionary algorithm are studied with further experiments and their utility is verified with statistical tests.},

 abstract     = {This paper investigates the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA?s) to evolve optimal strategies to the Prisoner?s Dilemma, a classic game theory problem. The problem was heavily studied in the 1980?s, but using more advanced computing techniques, this research extends the existing body of research. My hypothesis is that populations evolve to exhibit two traits: the ability to defend against defectors, and the ability to cooperate with other cooperators. Two successful, well studied strategies which embody these traits, Pavlov and Tit for Tat, are used as controls. Populations that do not possess these traits a priori are evolved and then compared to the performance of the controls. The results presented here strongly indicate that the hypothesized traits are present in all evolved populations.},

 abstract     = {In this paper we introduce a new approach for Genetic Programming, called rule-based Genetic Programming, or RBGP in short. A program evolved in the RBGP syntax is a list of rules. Each rule consists of two conditions, combined with a logical operator, and an action part. Such rules are independent from each other in terms of position (mostly) and cardinality (always). This reduces the epistasis drastically and hence, the genetic reproduction operations are much more likely to produce good results than in other Genetic Programming methodologies. In order to verify the utility of our idea, we apply RBGP to a hard problem in distributed systems. With it, we are able to obtain emergent algorithms for mutual exclusion at a distributed critical section.},

A critical problem with such an approach is how can the designer make sure the plans are reliable. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a formal approach for modeling and analyzing multi-agent behaviors using Predicate/Transition (PrT) nets, a high-level formalism of Petri nets. We construct a multi-agent model by representing agent capabilities as transitions. To verify a multi-agent PrT model, we adapt the planning graphs as a compact structure for the reachability analysis. We also demonstrate that, based on the PrT model, whether parallel actions specified in multi-agent plans can be executed in parallel and whether the plans guarantee the achievement of the goal can be verified by analyzing the dependency relations among the transitions.},

This paper presents an approach for generating parallel execution plans based on the planning graph analysis. Instead of representing a planning problem by STRIPS operators, we model multi-agent planning domains using Predicate/Transition (PrT) nets (a high-level formalism of Petri nets), which are well suited for capturing dynamic behaviors of concurrent systems. We demonstrate that the planning graph analysis is adaptable for the analysis of PrT nets. Based on the planning graph analysis of a PrT net, a parallel plan with explicit representation of parallel actions can be automatically generated.},

The aim is to have knowledge and computing power diffused in the environment, exploiting the collaboration of simple, flexible and cost-effective robots. Collective intelligence increases when each one communicates basic information about its local state, to update the global knowledge. An open research problem is the cooperation among multiple entities in a distributed environment. Our proposal is to have robots with low capabilities that can learn information and instructions from on-site RFID landmarks to place themselves in formation, synchronise with other robots in the area, and finally carry out a cooperative task.},

By applying the models to new user activities, the system can detect an imposter, or verify a user�s legitimate activity. In this research, original datastreams are lists of records extracted from the operating system�s process table. The learned user signatures (LUS) are primarily in the reported results in the form of sets of multistate templates (MTs), each characterizing one pattern in the user�s behavior. Advantages of the method include the significant expressive power of the representation (a single template can characterize a large number of different user behaviors) and the ease of their interpretation, which makes possible their editing or enhancement by an expert. Presented initial results show a great promise and power of the method.},

Collaborative programming or pair programming is one of the more relevant areas at present in providing efficient solutions to the working groups management, in such a way that their impact on the software development process is indisputable. The main purpose of this document is to gather the most relevant aspects of the collaborative models in a collaborative framework based on the use of software agents.

We give a short introduction to Genetic Algorithms. Our new Distributed Genetic Programming Framework facilitates the development of sensor network applications. Genetic evolution of programs requires program testing. Therefore we use a simulation environment for distributed systems of sensor nodes. The simulation model takes into account characteristic features of sensor nodes, such as unreliable communication and resource constraints. Two application examples are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and its potential to create robust ,and adaptive code for sensor network applications.},

The new features include a deep integration of machine learning and conventional evolution modes, capabilities for defining the fitness evaluation function outside of the main program, setting up LEM3 parameters, and deciding what information to be outputted by the program. LEM3 appears to be particularly suitable for solving complex optimization problems in which the fitness evaluation function is time-consuming, Another important feature is that it can be applied to the optimization of non-numerical problems involving multitype attributes.},
