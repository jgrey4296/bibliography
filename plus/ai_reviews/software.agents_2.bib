 abstract     = {Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organization or coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current task environment. We show that different combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP schedules tasks with deadlines, it allows agent heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple levels of abstraction. We analyze the performance of several GPGP algorithm family members and one centralized upper bound reference algorithm, using data from simulations of multiple agent teams working in abstract task environments. We show how to decide if adding a new mechanism is useful, and suggest a way to prune the search for an appropriate combination of mechanisms in an environment.},

 abstract     = {This report details a survey of systems providing process or object migration. After an introduction to the topic a number of systems are covered in detail. Four chapters deal with systems providing migration over unmodified UNIX, those providing {\textquotedblleft}classical{\textquotedblright} process migration and containing modified or new kernels, migration over modern microkernel based operating systems and finally those providing more general {\textquotedblleft}object{\textquotedblright} migration. The coverage of each system contains a general overview, a detailed examination of the migration subsystem and load balancing support, if any. Migration support is sectioned into an overview, an examination of the migration mechanisms, the effects of migration on inter (task) communication, and details of any environment and associated resource transfer. The summary provides comments on the major design issues identified within the report. It notes that solutions running over raw UNIX are the least complete, and that some level of kernel modification is generally necessary in order to provide good migration support. Microkernel architectures are shown be useful to the developers of a migration subsystem due to their modularity, which tends to ease the encapsulation of process state. The {\textquotedblleft}object{\textquotedblright} paradigm is similarly shown to aid both encapsulation and post migration communication. Finally, a note is made that very few research topics seem to remain in the construction of a process migration system since the majority of design issues have now been addressed. No one system is found to provide a complete range of features, however.},

The rating servers predict scores based on the heuristic that people who agreed in the past will probably agree again. Users can protect their privacy by entering ratings under pseudonyms, without reducing the effectiveness of the score prediction. The entire architecture is open: alternative software for news clients and Better Bit Bureaus can be developed independently and can interoperate with the components we have developed.},

In this paper, I discuss many issues involved in implementing Tcl, and describe a design for a faster system that maintains Tcl semantics, including its C callout mechanism. This design focuses on a method for caching the parsed representation for data values, and lazily converting to strings on demand. This allows most computations to be performed using native types (eg. integers) rather than strings. The current implementation is presented along with results showing a speedup of about 5-10 times over the existing Tcl interpreter.},

Current work in the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort has addressed the information contentlevel by the KIF language and the intentional level by the KQML langauge. In this paper we address the coordination level by means of our coordination language (COOL) that relies on speech act based communication, but integrates it in a stuctured conversation framework that captures the coordination mechanisms agents use when working together. We are currently using this language (i) to represent coordination mechanisms for the supply chain of manufacturing modeled as intelligent agents, and (ii) as an environment fo rdesigning and validating coordination protocols for multi-agent systems. This paper describes the basic elements of this language: conversation objects, conversation rules, error recovery rules, continuation rules, conversation nesting. The actual COOL source code and a running trace for the n-queens problem are presented in the Appendix.},

It takes the view that rational agents do not change their attitudes without reason, and aims to represent such changes in teleological theories. the infrastructure of these theories contain persistence rules which state that agents attitudes persist unless they have reason to change them. Theories giving the agents' reasons for changing their attitudes build on these. This leads to a discussion of rationality in resource-bounded agents and the paper concludes by outlining an AI-planning theory of rational agency.},

Such applications are not tied to one user or one machine, and can roam freely over the network, rendering service to a community of users, gathering human input and interacting with people. We envisage that this will support many new agent-based collaboration metaphors. The ability to migrate executing programs has applicability to mobile computing as well. Users can have their applications travel with them, as they move from one computing environment to another. We present an elegant programming model for creating migratory applications and describe an implementation. The biggest strength of our implementation is that the details of migration are completely hidden from the application programmer; arbitrary user interface applications can be migrated by a single {\textquotedblleft}migration{\textquotedblright} command. We address system issues such as robustness, persistence and memory usage, and also human factors relating to application design the interaction metaphor and safety.},

Such applications are not tied to one user or one machine, and can roam freely over the network, rendering service to a community of users, gathering human input and interacting with people. We envisage that this will support many new agent-based collaboration metaphors. The ability to migrate executing programs has applicability to mobile computing as well. Users can have their applications travel with them, as they move from one computing environment to another. We present an elegant programming model for creating migratory applications and describe an implementation. The biggest strength of our implementation is that the details of migration are completely hidden from the application programmer; arbitrary user interface applications can be migrated by a single `migration' command. We address system issues such as robustness, persistence and memory usage, and also human factors relating to the application design process, the interaction metaphor and safety.},

This is an extension to the client / server model in which the client sends a portion of itself to the server for execution. An additional feature of itinerant agents is their ability to migrate from server to server, perhaps seeking one that can help with the user's task or perhaps collecting information from all of them. A major focus of the paper is the Agent Meeting Point, an abstraction that supports the interaction of agents with each other and server based resources.},

By using this language for communication, agents will be able to request and deliver services to one another. Indeed, numerous projects have shown how the language can profitably support interoperation among distributed agents. However, before becoming a widely-accepted standard, it would be worthwhile to examine the language in detail. This paper explores semantical issues raised by KQML, specifically the use of performatives for interagent communication. Numerous difficulties with the language are identified, and an attempt is made to point to their resolution. The paper illustrates the kind of semantics we believe to be necessary to characterize agent communication languages, and applies it to compose a question from a request and an inform. Finally, the paper discusses possible impacts to be felt on various KQML decisions from the semantical issues raised here.},

While such a programming environment is adequate for many tasks, object-based RPC systems and statically compiled languages also have certain intrinsic limitations. These limitations become significant when writing applications which are both distributed and interactive (e.g. network information browsers, distributed conferencing systems and collaborative work tools). This paper discusses these limitations, and presents the design of Phantom, a new intepreted language for distributed programming. Phantom provides many features found in object-based RPC systems and statically compiled languages, including automatic marshalling, transparent remote procedure call, secure authentication and concurrency support. In addition to these traditional features, Phantom's interpreted nature permits the use of certain programming techniques, such as true object migration, remote evaluation, and dynamic extensibility, which are of increasing importance for distributed programming, but which are not available in statically compiled languages and RPC systems. The integration of these features in a single, coherent programming language makes whole new classes of distributed, interactive applications possible.},

 abstract     = {Agent-Based Software Integration (ABSI) entails the development of intelligent software agents and knowledge-sharing protocols that enhance interoperability of multiple software packages. Although some past ABSI projects reported in the literature have been concerned with the integration of relatively large software frameworks from separate engineering disciplines, the discussion in this paper concerns the integration of general-purpose software utilities and hand-crafted tools. With such smaller-scale ABSI projects, it may be difficult to justify the expense of constructing an overall ontology for the application. There are cases, however, when the project involves general-purpose tools that manipulate the same general entity types (such as files) but at different levels of abstraction. In such cases it is appropriate to have ontologies appropriate for the general usage of each tool and constraint descriptions that enable the ontological specifications to be mapped across the various levels of abstraction. This paper discusses issues associated with this type of ABSI project and describes an example information management application associated with university course administration. For the information management application presented the key issues are the provision of standard agent wrappers for standard desktop information management tools and the design of standard ontologies describing information stored in relational databases as well as in structured text files. Examples of a conceptual model describing such a database ontology are presented in connection with the example application. It also suggested that a general planning agent, distinct from the notion of a facilitator agent, be employed in this context to assist in the use of various agents to manipulate information and move items from one data format to another.},

This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current task environment. We show that different combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP allows more agent heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple levels of abstraction.},

Much work in this field can be seen as a search for mechanisms that allow agents with differing knowledge and goals to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit. Additionally, one cornerstone assumption of the field is that communication is expensive relative to local computation. Thus, coordination techniques that minimize communication are of particular importance. This paper considers how automated agents could use a coordination technique common to communication-free human interactions, namely focal points. Given a problem and a set of possible solutions from which the agents need to choose one, focal points are prominent solutions of the problem to which agents are drawn. Theoretical work on this subject includes~i̧teschelling63,kraus91a. The purpose of the current research is to consider the practical use of focal point techniques in various domains. We present simulations over randomly generated domains; these simulations strongly suggest that focal points can act as an effective heuristic for coordination in real-world environments.},

The proposed multi-layered architecture allows a rationally bounded, goal-directed agent to reason predictively about potential conflicts by constructing causal theories which explain other agents' observed behaviors and hypothesize their intentions; at the same time it enables the agent to operate autonomously and to react promptly to changes in its real-time environment. A principal aim of this research is to understand the role different functional capabilities play in constraining an agent's behavior under varying environmental conditions. To this end, an experimental testbed has been constructed comprising a simulated multi-agent world in which a variety of agent configurations and behaviors have been investigated. A number of experimental findings are reported.},

Although we may have some intuitions about how some parameters could affect the scheduling efficiency and meeting quality, we run several experiments in order to explore the tradeoffs between different parameters. Our experiments show how the calendar and preference privacy affect the schedulling efficiency and the meeting joint quality under different experimental scenarios. The results show how the schedulling performance is more stable and constant when agents try to keep both calendar and preference privacy. We believe that these parameters play a key role in the distributed meeting scheduling task, specially if we are interested in building distributed systems with truly autonomous and independent agents where there is not a fixed centralized host agent.},

A transportable agent is a named program that can migrate from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. Such programs are a powerful tool for implementing information agents since the electronic resources in a user's information space are often distributed across a network and can contain tremendous quantities of data. Sending a user-specific program to the network location of the resource is often the most convenient and e\ensuremath{<}cient alternative. The goal of Agent Tcl is to address the weaknesses of existing transportable-agent systems. Agent Tcl will run on standard hardware, support multiple languages and transport mechanisms, provide transparent migration and communication, and provide effective security and fault-tolerance in the uncertain world of the Internet. This paper describes the architecture of Agent Tcl and its current implementation and presents four informationmanagement applications in which Agent Tcl has proven useful.},

A transportable agent is a named program that can migrate from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. The program chooses when and where to migrate. It can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport to another machine and resume execution on the new machine. Transportable agents have several advantages over the traditional client/server model. Transportable agents consume less network bandwidth and do not require a connection between communicating machines {\textendash} this is attractive in all networks and particularly attractive in wireless networks. Transportable agents are a convenient paradigm for distributed computing since they hide the communication channels but not the location of the computation. Transportable agents allow clients and servers to program each other. However transportable agents pose numerous challenges such as security, privacy and efficiency. Existing transportable agent systems do not meet all of these challenges. In addition there has been no formal characterization of the performance of transportable agents. This thesis addresses these weakness. The thesis has two parts {\textendash} (1) formally characterize the performance of transportable agents through mathematical analysis and network simulation and (2) implement a complete transportable agent system.},

 abstract     = {We raise and discuss several issues of advice taking and instruction, including: the challenges of very small samples of opinion, and of assimilation with a large, complex prior knowledge base. We focus expecially on the problem of conflicting yes/no rules. We observe the availability of natural kinds of information, e.g., authority, reliability, freshness, and specificity, as teh basis for reasoning about precedence. by precedence we mean in the sense of resolving conflicts between rules on the basis of qualitative ordinal information. We propose an approach to this problem of conflict: via defaults and reasoning about such precendence. drewn from knowledge representation and commonsense reasoning. We initially developed this approach in previous work. Here, we elaborate it, abstract it to a more conceptual level, and present it for a machine learning audience. Also, we abstract it away from the details of, and dependency on, one aprticular non-monotonic logical formalism. We see the value of this approach not as being all-embracing, but as providing a step towards elements of future approaches to advice-taking and instruction.},

Besides basic inferencing, these include embeddability, reusability, user-friendly authoring of rules, communicability of rules, flexibility especially of inferencing control strategy and performance, and extensibility of representation and reasoning. We develop an architecture that fulfills these requirements to a substantial degree: RAISE (Reusable Agent Intelligence Software Environment). RAISE provides building blocks for embeddable agent smarts. It is founded upon a declarative representation and clean semantics, equipped with a sample yet powerful appraoch to procedural attachments. This results in highly pluggable components for inferenciing, authoring, and communication embodied in a fine-grained object-oriented class library. We have found RAISe to enable high reusability of both code and knowledge while embedding rule-based intelligence enhancements in three prototyped infromation agent applications: personal messaging, newgroups filtering and handling for customer service support (the Globenet system), and collaborative news service in Lotus Notes.},

We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices are evaluated against the design criteria.},

For this purpose we develop a formal theory with an internal perspective, which enables us to identify the key data structures and specify the relationships between them. The reasoning processes are described in terms of beliefs, desires and intentions of individual agents. The logical model of these attitudes are used to formally define a number of important states including agent to agent commitment. The reasoning processes are in essence the transitions through these states, specified by a set of rules as part of our specification language. As a result of these processes, an agent may adopt goals to communicate. These goals are fed back into the reasoning process to find appropriate communication plans that fulfill them. Our approach is therefore pragmatic since it enables a direct coupling of our theoretical concepts to an implementable model.},

 abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the amount of information available to our society. In particular, the amount of information available on-line through vast networks like the global Internet has been growing at a staggering rate. This growth rate has by far exceeded the rate of growth in network speeds, as has the number of individuals and organizations seeking access to this information. There is thus a motivation to find abstract methods of manipulating this on-line data in ways that both serve the needs of end users efficiently and use network resources intelligently. In lieu of a traditional client-server model of information processing, which is both inflexible and potentially very inefficient, a Transportable Intelligent Agent system has the potential to achieve a more efficient and flexible network system. An intelligent agent is a program that models the information space for a user, and allows the user to specify how the information is to be processed. A transportable agent can suspend its execution, transport itself to a new location on a network, and resume execution at the new location. This is a particularly attractive model for both wireless and dialup networks where a user might not be able to maintain a permanent network connection, as well as for situations where the amount of information to be processed is large relative to the network bandwidth. Preliminary work in the field has shown that such agent systems are possible and deserve further study. This thesis describes a prototype transportable intelligent agent system that extends work already done in the field. Agents are written in a modified version of the Tcl programming language and transported using TCP/IP connections. Several simple examples demonstrate the properties of the system.},

The characters work together to improvise a course of behavior that follows the directions, expresses their distinctive individual styles, honors social conventions, and meets other objectives. The resulting ''performance'' reflects the collaboration among all of the human and computer agents. Directed improvisation has several attractive properties as a paradigm for multiagent human-computer interaction, which we illustrate in our testbed application, a ''computer-animated improvisational theater'' for children. Directed improvisation also presents distinctive agent requirements that make it a useful addition to the domain of multiagent paradigms: demand for situated, spontaneous, opportunistic behavior; demand for very intimate agent interaction and shared control; and emphasis on process-oriented evaluation criteria.},

We have explored the issue of early versus late commitment to the uncertain information thus gained and the resulting tradeoff between time and effort as the commitment level is changed. Our results show that while in some situations it is worthwhile delaying commitment until uncertainty is reduced, in other situations it is important to act even when uncertainty is high.

Two existing alternatives to this approach are described: programming of agent verbal behavior and training adaptive agents to comply with rules through experience with many examples. Specific advantages are listed for learning as compared with each of these alternatives. The paper describes training adaptive critic agents using methods based on Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior. Using demonstrations which will become available on the Web, the paper describes specific training procedures to teach the agent to imitate, to name objects and properties, to follow instructions, and to memorize verbal advice. Together those skills enable the agent to memorize a rule and correctly follow it the first time the agent sees the condition described in the rule. The early successes reported here, along with the huge practical advantages of the approach if it continues to be successful, encourage us to continue developing and testing agent technology based on this analysis.},

Each agent is made to repetitively engage in a deal equivalent to the {\textquotedblleft}Prisoner's Dilemma{\textquotedblright} game, each time changing the other party of the deal. The conditions of the deal are that the contract histories of all the agents are disclosed to the public. Several deal strategies are evaluated, and their behaviors are investigated by matching them under various conditions. Next the social evolution of deal strategies is investigated using genetic algorithm techniques. Each agent can bear a child according to the profit he gets through the deal. The child inherits the deal strategy of the parent, but the random mutation is introduced to the inheritance of strategies. It is shown that the robust and cooperative strategies emerges through the evolution starting from a simple {\textquotedblleft}Tit for Tat{\textquotedblright} algorithms.},

 abstract     = {An {\textquotedblleft}agent{\textquotedblright} is a process that may migrate through a computer network in order to satisfy requests made by its clients. Agents implement a computational metaphor that is analogous to how most people conduct business in their daily lives: visit a place, use a service (perhaps after some negotiation), and then move on. Thus, for the computer illiterate, agents are an attractive way to describe networka-wide computations. Agents are also useful abstractions for programmers who must implement distributed applications. This is because in the agent metaphor, the processor or {\textquotedblleft}place{\textquotedblright} the computation is performed is not hidden from the programmer, but the communications channels are. Most current research on agents has focused on language design and application issues. The TACOMA project (Troms{\o} And COrnell Moving Agents) has, instead, focused on operating system support for agents and how agents can be used to solve problems traditionally addressed by operating systems. We have implemented prototype systems to support agents using UNIX and using Tcl/Tk on top of Horus. This paper outlines insights and questions based on that experience. We discuss abstractions needed by an operating system to support agents, and discuss some problems that arise in connection with electronic commerce involving agents.},

A relocatable dynamic object is an object with a well-defined interface that can be dynamically loaded into a client computer from a server computer (or vice versa) to reduce client-server communication requirements. Queued remote procedure call is a communication system that permits applications to continue to make non-blocking remote procedure call requests even whena host is disconnected, with requests and responses being exchanged upon network reconnection. The challenges of mobile environments include intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and channel-use optimization. Experimental results from a Rover-based mail reader, calendar program, and two non-blocking versions of World-Wide Web browsers show that Rover's services are a good match to these challenges. The Rover toolkit also offers advantages for workstation applications by providing a uniform distributed object architecture for code shipping, object caching, and asynchronous object invocation.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are code-containing objects that may be transmitted between communicating participants in a distributed system. As opposed to systems that only allow the exchange of nonexecutable data, systems incorporating mobile agents can achieve significant gains in performance and functionality. A programming language for mobile agents must be able to express their construction, transmission, receipt, and subsequent execution. Its implementation must handle architectural heterogeneity between communicating machines and provide sufficient performance for applications based on agents. In addition to these essential properties, an agent language may support desirable properties such as high-level abstractions for code manipulation and the ability to access resources on remote execution sites. We designed and implemented an agent programming language that satisfies the essential properties and a number of desirable ones. A key feature of our language is the use of strong static typing for remote resource access. Agents may be linked dynamically to resources on remote sites, and this linking is always guaranteed to be type safe. We provide this guarantee without requiring that all components of an agent-based system be compiled together. Our language also includes several features to improve the performance of mobile agents. Before an agent is transmitted, it is trimmed of values that are expected to be available on the recipient, thus shrinking transmissions. Agents may be interpreted or compiled depending on the application and the relative performance trade-offs. When compilation is used, it is done lazily: Each component of an agent is only compiled as it is needed. Furthermore, machine-specific representations for an agent can be transmitted with machine-independent ones, opening the possibility for recipients to skip compilation or interpretation altogether. To evaluate our language and to explore the potential of mobile agents, we developed a programming framework for agents. Several applications were implemented by other programmers within this framework using our language. Their work served to validate our design and our choice of agent language properties. We also analyzed the performance of our language on these applications and several synthetic benchmarks. The analysis shows that the features we incorporated into the implementation significantly improve performance.},

We are developing an infrastructure for the support of mobile agents which is based on a network of `agent servers'. Each of these controls the agents visiting a host, allows for status checks and intervention by the agents' owners and provides a means of communication for the agents under its control. Mobile agents can be written in a number of programming languages such as Tcl and Perl; the agent environment provides runtime support through dedicated libraries that add relocation and communication capabilities to the respective language.

We present an approach that consists of a standard operating procedure and a look-ahead coordination. The standard operating procedure regulates task coupling and minimizes communication. The look-ahead coordination increases agents' global visibility and provides indicative information for decision adjustment. The goal of our approach is to prune decision myopia while maintaining system responsiveness in real-time, dynamic environments. Experimental results in job shop scheduling problems show that (1) the look-ahead coordination significantly enhances the performance of the standard operating procedure in solution quality, (2) the approach is capable of producing solutions of very high quality in a real-time environment.},

The formal semantics of cooperation primitives gives a meaning to indiviudal messages, independent from the cooperation protocol.

April is oriented to the implementation of multi-agent systems. However, April is NOT a `multi-agent applications language'.

 abstract     = {The study of computational agents capable of rational behaviour has received a great deal of attention in recent years. A number of theoretical formalizations for such multi-agent systems have been proposed. However, most of these formalizations do not have a strong semantic basis nor a sound and complete axiomatization. Hence, it has not been clear as to how these formalizations could be used in building agents in practice. This paper explores a particular type of multi-agent system, in which each agent is viewed as having the three mental attitudes of belief (B), desire (D), and intention (I). It provides a family of multi-modal branching-time BDI logics with a semantics that is grounded in traditional decision theory and a possible-worlds framework, categorizes them, provides sound and complete axiomatizations, and gives constructive tableau-based decision procedures for testing the satisfiability and validity of formulas. The computational complexity of these decision procedures is no greater than the complexity of their underlying temporal logic component. The paper thus provides a basis for developing formal methods to assist in the specification, design, and verification of complex multi-agent systems.},

These issues are presented in the context of iterative task allocation negotiations. First, the reasons why such agents need to be able to choose the stage and level of commitment dynamically are identified. A protocol that allows such choices through conditional commitment breaking penalties is presented. Next, the implications of bounded rationality are analyzed. Several tradeoffs between allocated computation and negotiation benefits and risk are enumerated, and the necessity of explicit local deliberation control is substantiated. Techniques for linking negotiation items and multiagent contracts are presented as methods for escaping local optima in the task allocation process. Implementing both methods among self-interested bounded rational agents is discussed. Finally, the problem of message congestion among self-interested agents is described, and alternative remedies are presented.},

We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, improtant features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and expose various phenomena related to the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. In addition, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even deteriorate system efficiency.},

We argue that agents should be provided with deep domain knowledge that allos them to make justifiable decisions, rather than shallow models of users to mimic. In this paper, we use the application domain of distributed meeting scheduling to investigate how agents embodying deeper domain knowledge can choose among alternative strategies for searching their calendars in order to create flexible schedules within reasonable cost.},

Four different algorithms for making recommendations by using social information filtering were tested and compared. We present quantitative and qualitative results obtained from the use of Ringo by more than 2000 people.},

 abstract     = {We present a technique for moving objects and threads among heterogeneous computers at the native code level. To enable mobility of threads running native code, we convert thread states among machine-dependent and machine-independent formats. We introduce the concept of bus stops, which are machine-independent representations of program points as represented by program counter values. The concept of bus stops can be used also for other purposes, e.g., to aid inspecting and debugging optimized code, garbage collection etc. We also discuss techniques for thread mobility among processors executing differently optimized codes. We demonstrate the viability of our ideas by providing a prototype implementation of object and thread mobility among heterogeneous computers. The prototype uses the Emerald distributed programming language without modification; we have merely extended the Emerald runtime system and the code generator of the Emerald compiler. Our extensions allow object and thread mobility among VAX, Sun-3, HP9000/300, and Sun SPARC workstations. The excellent intra-node performance of the original homogeneous Emerald is retained: migrated threads run at native code speed before and after migration; the same speed as on homogeneous Emerald and close to C code performance. Our implementation of mobility has not been optimized: thread mobility and trans-architecture invocations take about 60},

These agents were implemented and different populations simulated in order to learn more about their behavior and the merits of using agent models. Our results show, among other lessons, how savvy buyers can avoid being {\textquotedblleft}cheated{\textquotedblright} by sellers, how price volatility can be used to quantitatively predict the benefits of deeper models, and how specific types of agent populations influence system behavior.},
