This representation, based on a structure sharing approach, is used to compute queries in hierarchical disjunctive deductive databases. Algorithms are presented to compute the minimal models of these programs, and a query answering procedure that extracts a complete set of answers is defined. The hierarchical structure allows the use of an incremental approach to compute answers where each rule is evaluated only once.},
