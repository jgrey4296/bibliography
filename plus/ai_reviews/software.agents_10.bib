 abstract     = {Mobile agents are an increasingly popular paradigm, and in recent years there has been a proliferation of mobile-agent systems. These systems are, however, largely incompatible with each other. In particular, agents cannot migrate to a host that runs a different mobile-agent system. Prior approaches to interoperability have tried to force agents to use a common API, and so far none have succeeded. Our goal, summarized in the catch phrase {\textquotedblleft}Write Once, Move Anywhere,{\textquotedblright} led to our efforts to develop mechanisms that support dynamic runtime interoperability of mobile-agent systems. This paper describes the Grid Mobile-Agent System, which allows agents to migrate to different mobile-agent systems.},

We have implemented a series of prototype systems to support agents. We are currently focusing on heterogeneity, fault-tolerance, security and management issues. Also, several TACOMA applications are under construction. One example is a wide-area network weather monitoring system accessible over the internet, using TACOMA and Java.},
