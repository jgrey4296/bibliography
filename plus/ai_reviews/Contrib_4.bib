 abstract     = {With the growing acceptance of service-oriented computing, an emerging area of research is the investigation of technologies that will enable the discovery and composition of web services. The Web Services Challenge (WSC) is a forum where academic and industry researchers can share experiences of developing tools that automate the integration of web services. In the fifth year (i.e. WSC-09) of the Web Services Challenge, software platforms will address several new composition challenges. Requests and results will be transmitted within SOAP messages. Semantics will be represented as ontologies written in OWL, services will be represented in WSDL, and service orchestrations will be represented in WSBPEL. In addition, non-functional properties (Quality of Service) of a service will be represented using WSLA format.},

Under the assumption that the mutation probability is zero, the search ability of the GA's is discussed. It is proved that the degree of population diversity converges to zero with probability one so that the search ability of a GA decreases and premature convergence occurs. Moreover, an explicit formula for the conditional probability of allele loss at a certain bit position is established to show the relationships between premature convergence and the GA parameters, such as population size, mutation probability, and some population stattistics.},

The proposed navigation strategy is a finite-state machine that integrates three navigation aspects. This strategy falls in the category of hybrid architectures. The two aspects other than path planning discussed in this paper are path tracking and obstacle avoidance. Other aspects and behaviours can easily be added. For path tracking, a fuzzy control technique is suggested. The fuzzy controller is used to drive the robot through a set of waypoints leading to the destination. The curvature velocity method is proposed for obstacle avoidance. The testing was conducted on a P3-AT all-terrain mobile robot equipped with encoders, a gyroscope and sonar sensors for localisation and environment perception. The test results validate the theoretical analysis},

While most of these are based on controlling the robot dynamics, they are not applicable if the robot dynamics are inaccessible. In this paper, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for the path tracking of a wheeled mobile robot based on controlling the robot at a higher level is presented. The controller is highly robust and flexible and automatically follows a sequence of discrete waypoints, and no interpolation of the waypoints is needed to generate a continuous reference trajectory. The speeds are varied depending on the variations in the path and on the posture of the robot. The heuristic rules of the FLC are based on an analogy with a human driving a car and the optimization of the controller is based on experimentation. The implementation on a P3-AT mobile robot shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
