This paper describes a brief overview of research in web-based intelligent information systems. More specifically, this position paper describes the need for research in intelligent agent technology for use in mediating information, information filtering, and negotiation between agents during multimedia-based presentations to the end user via the web. Research techniques from the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) area are explored to provide methods for coordinating activities of agents as well as provide mechanisms for conflict resolution among these agents. Additional agent massaging languages, such as KQML, are also being considered.},

It focuses on mechanisms they employ to execute mobile code safely, meaning that such code is encapsulated, and interacts with its host only via a permitted interface. While the systems are diverse, it may be argued that each presents a different approach to safety. Java is statically type-checked during compilation and verified in bytecode form at load time. Kali-Scheme is also compiled to bytecodes, but is dynamically checked since Scheme is latently typed. Software-based fault isolation provides a lower level of encapsulation by directly inserting checks on control and data flow into the object code. Both software-based fault isolation and static type checking are found to be efficient. They need to address the issue of carrying checking information in the mobile code, however, while interpretation largely separates the issues of mobility and safety. Static type checking provides tighter integration of mobile code and host than sandboxing or interpretation.},

Previous approaches to implementing mobile code rely on either language semantics or abstract machine interpretation to enforce safety. In the former case, the mobile code system sacrifices universality to gain safety by dictating a particular source language or type system. In the latter case, the mobile code system sacrifices performance to gain safety through abstract machine interpretation. Omniware uses software fault isolation, a technology developed to provide safe extension code for databases and operating systems, to achieve a unique combination of language-independence and excellent performance. Software fault isolation uses only the semantics of the underlying processor to determine whether a mobile code module can corrupt its execution environment. This separation of programming language implementation from program module safety enables our mobile code system to use a radically simplified virtual machine as its basis for portability. We measured the performance of Omniware using a suite of four SPEC92 programs on the Pentium, PowerPC, Mips, and Sparc processor architectures. Including the overhead for enforcing safety on all four processors, OmniVM executed the benchmark programs within 21},

 abstract     = {With the development and diffusion of the Internet worldwide connection, a large amount of information can be delivered to the users. To avoid their being overflowed by the incoming data, methods of information filtering are required. Thus, there is the problem of determining what information is relevant to the user and how this decision can be taken by a supporting system. Parametric and qualitative descriptors of user's interest must be generated. This paper presents two approaches. The first concerns an information filtering system based on an adaptation of the generalized probabilistic model of information retrieval. The user profile is a vector of weighted terms which are learned from the relevance assessment values given by the user on the training set. Positive terms are considered relevant to the informative need of the user, negative ones irrelevant. The relevance values are interpreted as subjective probabilities and hence are mapped into the real interval [0; 1]. ProFile is a filtering system for the netnews which uses this model with a scale of 11 predefined values of relevance. ProFile allows the user to update on-line his profile and to check the discrepancy between his assessment and the prediction of relevance of the system. The second concerns the InfoAgent, a system for supporting users in retrieving data in distributed and heterogeneous archives and repositories. The architecture is based on the metaphor of the software agents and incorporates innovative hints from other fields: distributed architectures, relevance feedback and active interfaces. The system has a cooperative and supportive role: it understands the user's needs and learns from his behavior. Its aim is to disengage the user from learning complex tools and from performing tedious and repetitive actions.},

However, autonomous agents are increasingly used in areas related to art, entertainment, and user interface. Established fields of art and entertainment (such as film, literature, and theater) depend on believable characters more than intelligent ones. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the AI research community to study a new kind of autonomous agent, where the focus is on believability, not intelligence. I will argue that this opportunity exists, summarize the goals I see for believable agents researchs, and try to explain the key differences between believability and traditional scientific goals such as intelligence and realism. I will conclude with the suggestion that AI's founding dreams demand both intelligence and believability.},

 abstract     = {Agents that operate in a multi-agent system need an efficient strategy to handle their encounters with other agents involved. Searching for an optimal interactive strategy is a hard problem because it depends mostly on the behavior of the others. In this work, interaction among agents is represented as a repeated two-player game, where the agents' objective is to look for a strategy that maximizes their expected sum of rewards in the game. We assume that agents' strategies can be modeled as finite automata. A model-based approach is presented as a possible method for learning an effective interactive strategy. First, we describe how an agent should find an optimal strategy against a given model. Second, we present an unsupervised algorithm that infers a model of the opponent's automaton from its input/output behavior. A set of experiments that show the potential merit of the algorithm is reported as well.},

 abstract     = {This paper concerns the development of interfaces which perform tasks on behalf of the user. Recently the concept of task delegation has gained consideration due to the increasing number of assignments that are quite repetitive and tedious, like dealing with electronic messages, managing personal agendas, retrieving data and information in remote and distributed repositories. These tasks are generally connected to the development of computer networks. The design of such interfaces presents a high degree of complexity since the relationship with the user and his needs is very critical: in most cases the user wants to control the jobs to be mechanized but in the same time he wants to be free from wasting his time in performing repetitive patterns of actions. In this paper the main problems concerning the design of active and cooperative interfaces are investigated. Then a solution is proposed based on the approaches of software agents and distributed architectures. Starting point of the project is to integrate and make accessible different tools and applications regularly utilized by a user: all these elements concur in building a flexible and scalable environment that the user can access through intelligent agents that work as interfaces.},

The ++ signifies that it is an OO extension of April bearing the same relationship to April as C++ does to C. The `Q' indicates an additional feature. The objects in AprilQ++ can have knowledge bases comprising sets of facts and recursive definitions of relations which can be queried, both locally and remotely, using Prolog style queries. AprilQ++ has one other significant feature. Using the higher order features of the underlying April, objects can be cloned, with the current state of the object encapsulated in a procedure closure. The clone can then migrate to be forked as a new active object running on a new host. This features enables us to implement mobile agents.},

Information agents construct such indices and are configured as a network of reusable modules called structure detectors and segmenters. We illustrate our architecture with the design and implementation of smart information filters in two contexts: retrieving stock market data from Internet newsgroups, and retrieving technical reports from Internet ftp sites.},

 abstract     = {An information agent is charged with the task of searching a collection of electronic resources for information that is relevant to the user's current needs. These resources are often distributed across a network and can contain tremendous quantities of data. One of the paradigms that has been suggested for allowing efficient access to such resources is transportable agents {\textendash} the agent is sent to the machine that maintains the information resource; the agent executes on this remote machine and then returns its results to the local machine. We have implemented a transportable agent system that uses the Tool Command Language (Tcl) as the agent language. Each Tcl script can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport itself to another machine and resume execution on the new machine. The execution state of the script {\textendash} which includes the commands that have not been executed {\textendash} must be transmitted to the new machine. Although the execution state tends to be small, there will be a large number of agents moving across the network in a large-scale system. Thus it is desirable to compress the execution state as much as possible. Furthermore any compression scheme must be fast so that it does not become a bottleneck between the transportable agent system and the network routines. In this paper we explore several fast compression methods.},

These flaws arise for several reasons, including implementation errors, unintended interactions between browser features, differences between the Java language and bytecode semantics, and weaknesses in the design of the language and the bytecode format. On a deeper level, these flaws arise because of weaknesses in the design methodology used in creating Java and the browsers. In addition to the flaws, we discuss the underlying tension between the openness desired by Web application writers and the security needs of their users, and we suggest how both might be accommodated.},

A distinguishing characteristic of this implementation is the use of run-time type information, motivated by several constructs in the language. This is intended to motivate the use of run-time types in implementations of polymorphic languages intended for distributed programming.},

Despite its many practical benefits, mobile agent technology results in significant new security threats from malicious agents and hosts. The primary added complication is that, as an agent traverses multiple hosts that are trusted to different degrees, its state can change in ways that adversely impact its functionality. In this paper, we discuss achievable security goals for mobile agents, and we propose an architecture to achieve these goals. The architecture models the trust relations between the principals of mobile agent systems. A unique aspect of the architecture is a {\textquotedblleft}state appraisal{\textquotedblright} mechanism that protects users and hosts from attacks via state modifications and that provides users with flexible control over the authority of their agents.},

 abstract     = {Many popular programs, such as Netscape, use untrusted helper applications to process data from the network. Unfortunately, the unauthenticated network data they interpret could well have been created by an adversary, and the helper applications are usually too complex to be bug-free. This raises significant security concerns. Therefore, it is desirable to create a secure environment to contain untrusted helper applications. We propose to reduce the risk of a security breach by restricting the program's access to the operating system. In particular, we intercept and filter dangerous system calls via the Solaris process tracing facility. This enabled us to build a simple, clean, user-mode implementation of a secure environment for untrusted helper applications. Our implementation has negligible performance impact, and can protect pre-existing applications.},

We argue that these mobile, autonomous agents have the potential to provide a convenient, efficient and robust programming paradigm for distributed applications, particularly when partially connected computers are involved. Partially connected computers include mobile computers such as laptops and personal digital assistants as well as modem-connected home computers, all of which are often disconnected from the network. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of our mobile-agent system, Agent Tcl, and the specific features that support mobile computers and disconnected operation. These features include network-sensing tools and a docking system that allows an agent to transparently move between mobile computers, regardless of when the computers connect to the network.},

 abstract     = {Rapid and increasing advances in telecommunications and distributed systems have broadened the arena of possibilites for challenging new applications such as electronic markets, distributed intelligent information services, distributed manufacturing control, cooperative multi-robot applications, and many more. These advances have enabled access to a wide variety of communication networks, offering various means for logically or geographically distributed nodes to connect and communicate. With these possibilities real challenges are converging onto problems requiring better software engineering solutions. As programs are becoming more sophisticated they may collaborate and negotiate with other programs in order to achieve their assigned tasks. To do this they may need to communicate more intelligibly and exhibit sufficient flexibility to build up their dialogues dynamically and interactively. The ability to perform intelligent dialogues is particularly crucial when we have an open system where (heterogeneous) agents {\textquotedblleft}enter and leave{\textquotedblright} the system with little or no information about each other's capabilities. This book presents an approach towards the design of techniques enabling intelligent and flexible dialogues among agents in distributed environments. The approach draws together many ideas on speech acts, cooperation, dialogues and agent architectures, and devises a formal framework to define and specify the major components and the processes involved in reasoning about communication. Based on this framework, the book illustrates how reasoning about communication may be realised in practice. The most important practical benefit of the approach is the concept of {\textquotedblleft}cooperation protocols{\textquotedblright} which provide a mechanism to express various methods of cooperation and structure possible patterns of dialogue in those methods. The book is useful to many disciplines concerned with intelligent systems and intelligent behaviours. In particular it is intended to benefit those interested in high-level languages and standards for interagent communication and flexible dialogues. The incentives for this work, and the literature review material provided in the introductory chapters will be useful to those starting in the field of agent systems and agent theories.},

 abstract     = {This research has been motivated by the lack of models and languages in the visual design field that are able to address design solutions, which continuously adapt in response to the dynamic changes both in the information itself and in the goals or intentions of the information recipient. This paper postulates a multiagent model of dynamic design {\textendash} a theoretical framework of design that provides a model with which the visual designer can think during the course of designing. The model employs a decentralized model of design as a premise, and borrows its conceptual model from the improvisational performance, such as dance and music, and bases its theoretical and technical framework on the field of multiagent systems. A design solution is considered an emergent behavior of a collection of active design agents, or performers, each of which is responsible for presenting a particular segment of information. The graphical behaviors of design agents are described by their dynamic activities {\textendash} rather than by the traditional method of fixed attributes. The model is illustrated with two design projects, Dynamic News Display System and E-Mail Reader, both of which were implemented using a multiagent design simulation system, perForm, along with an agent description language, persona.},

 abstract     = {Downloading executable content, which enables principals to run programs from remote sites, is a key technology in a number of emerging applications, including collaborative systems, electronic commerce, and web information services. However, the use of downloaded executable content also presents serious security problems because it enables remote principals to execute programs on behalf of the downloading principal. Unless downloaded executable content is properly controlled, a malicious remote principal may obtain unauthorized access to the downloading principal's resources. Current solutions either attempt to strictly limit the capabilities of downloaded content or require complete trust in the remote principal, so applications which require intermediate amounts of sharing, such as collaborative applications, cannot be constructed over insecure networks. In this paper, we describe an architecture that flexibly controls the access rights of downloaded content by: (1) authenticating content sources; (2) determining content access rights based on its source and the application that it is implementing; and (3) enforcing these access rights over a wide variety of objects and for the entire computation, even if external software is used. We describe the architecture in the context of an infrastructure for supporting collaborative applications.},

One of the most significant issues in designing mobile object systems for world-wide networks is to provide the control needed to assure the protection and security of mobile objects and of computing resources. In this paper we describe our approach to this issue.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are code-containing objects that may be transmitted between communicating participants in a distributed system. Compared to systems that only allow the exchange of nonexecutable data, those incorporating mobile agents can achieve significant gains in performance and functionality. Languages with first-class functions provide a good starting point for agent programming, as they make it easy to express the construction, transmission, receipt, and subsequent execution of agents. However, for developing real agent-based systems, a language implementation must handle architectural heterogeneity between communicating machines and provide sufficient performance for applications based on agents. In addition, agents need to be able to access resources on remote execution sites yet remain in a framework that provides sufficient security. In this paper we consider the uses of mobile agents and how a distributed functional language can be extended to support them. We review other agent languages and present several observations on how further work in this area may proceed.},

 abstract     = {We address the issue of semantics for an agent communication language. In particular, the specification and semantics of Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML), and the logical architecture of KQML{\textendash}speaking agents are investigated. KQML is a language and protocol to support communication between (intelligent) software agents. First, we present a new specification for the KQML language that corrects a number of outstanding problems. Then, based on ideas from speech act theory, we propose a semantic description for KQML that associates {\textquotedblleft}cognitive{\textquotedblright} states of the agent with the use of the language's primitives (performatives). We use this approach to describe the semantics for the whole set of reserved KQML performatives. Building on the semantics, we devise the conversation policies, i.e., a formal description of how KQML performatives may be combined into KQML exchanges (conversations), using a Definite Clause Grammar. Finally, we present the code for a Prolog program that shows how the conversation policies can be incorporated in a software agent that speaks KQML. The research presented here finalizes the specification of KQML and provides semantics for the language. The accompanying code shows how this research can be used to build KQML agents that make use of all of the powerful features of KQML. Thus, we offer the research community a completely defined communication language that can be used for knowledge exchange between software agents. Also, our research offers methods for: (1) a speech act theory{\textendash}based semantic description of a language of communication acts, and (2) the specification of the protocols associated with these acts. Languages of communication acts address the issue of communication between software applications at a level of abstraction that could prove particularly useful to the emerging software agents paradigm of software design and developement.},

Recently emerging AOP plattforms claim to provide suitable technical support for the implementation of electronic market (EM) systems. EM systems allow both demanders and suppliers of services and goods in worldwide communication networks to cooperate freely based on electronic contracting and clearing services. This paper first argues that an open system infrastructure to support the {\textquotedblleft}right{\textquotedblright} programming paradigm is a necessary but not sufficient for fostering dynamic proliferation of EM's: Another important requirement is organizational openess of clientand server cooperations. The COSM (Common Open Service Market) infrastructure aims at a system support for such applications. It was designed and implemented to realize flexible means for accessing remote services dynamically in evolving electronic markets. The paper then shows how the COSM infrastructure can be extended by AOP concepts in order to provide an adequate open systems plattform to support highly flexible service offer and access.

 abstract     = {This paper argues that the 'mobile agent' approach is well suited for sporadic communication in open distributed systems - especially for rather 'loose' cooperations across local and organizational borders: In an increasing number of cases, modern (workflow) management of distributed business procedures reaches beyond such borders. For most existing workflow management systems this means that cooperations partner are required to give their local autonomy. However, for cases in which business partners intend to cooperate but still need to preserve their local autonomy, process participation on the basis of mobile agents represents an attractive and appropriate mechanism. Based on an order processing example, the paper shows how such kind of process integration can be achieved. It then demonstrates how the COSM (Common Open Service Market) system software can be extended in order to use petri net based process definitions with realize mobile agents in an integrated distributed system plattform. Finally, basic design and implementation considarations of mobile agents in COSM are also described. Final version published in Proc. PAAM '96, London, April, the 22th-24th},

We illustrate our formalization of this basic functionality of an agent by means of examples. We also show how our model fits into the transition system semantics of concurrent reactive systems by identifying the five basic transitions of vivid agent systems: perception, reaction, planning, action, and replanning.},

The code consumer can easily and quickly validate the proof without using cryptography and without consulting any external agents. In order to gain preliminary experience with proof-carrying code, we have performed a series of case studies. In one case study, we write safe assembly-language network packet filters. These filters can be executed with no run-time overhead, beyond a one-time cost of 1 to 3 milliseconds for validating the attached proofs. The net result is that our packet filters are formally guaranteed to be safe and are faster than packet filters created using Berkeley Packet Filters, Software Fault Isolation, or safe languages such as Modula-3. In another case study we show how proof-carrying code can be used to develop safe assembly-language extensions of the a simplified version of the TIL run-time system for Standard ML.},

The kernel first defines a safety policy and makes it public. Then, using this policy, an application can provide binaries in a special form called proof-carrying code, or simply PCC. Each binary contains, in addition to the native code, a formal proof that the code obeys the safety policy. The kernel can easily validate the proof without using cryptography and without consulting any external trusted entities. If the validation succeeds, the code is guaranteed to respect the safety policy without relying on run-time checks. The main practical difficulty of is in generating the safety proofs. In order to gain some preliminary experience with this, we have written several network packet filters in hand-tuned DEC Alpha assembly language, and then generated binaries for them using a special prototype assembler. The binaries can be executed with no run-time overhead, beyond a one-time cost of 1 to 3 milliseconds for validating the enclosed proofs. The net result is that our packet filters are formally guaranteed to be safe and are faster than packet filters created using Berkeley Packet Filters, Software Fault Isolation, or safe languages such as Modula-3.},

As part of their duties agents often need to communicate with other agents. We propose to use remote procedure call (RPC) along with a flexible interface definition language (IDL), to add structure to inter-agent communication. The real power of our Agent RPC comes from a client-server binding mechanism based on flexible IDL matching and from support for multiple simultaneous bindings. Our agents are programmed in Agent Tcl; we describe how the Tcl implementation made RPC particularly easy to implement. Finally, although our RPC is designed for Agent Tcl programs, the concepts would also work for standard Tcl programs.},

The execution environment of the safe interpreter is controlled by trusted scripts running in a master interpreter. Safe-Tcl provides an alias mechanism that allows applets to request services from the master interpreter in a controlled fashion.

As a consequence, the problem of programming agents is non trivial and poorly understood. In this paper we show that genetic programming can be used to automatically program agents which communicate and interact to solve problems. The programs evolved simulataneously define when and what to communicate, and how to use the communicated information to solve the given problem.},

Analysis of requirements showed a need to combine a wide variety of richly interacting mechanisms, including independent asynchronous sources of motivation and the ability to reflect on which motives to adopt, when to achieve them, how to achieve them, and so on. These internal `management' (and meta-management) processes involve a certain amount of parallelism, but resource limits imply the need for explicit control of attention. Such control problems can lead to emotional and other characteristically human affective states. In order to explore these ideas, we needed a toolkit to facilitate experiments with various architectures in various environments, including other agents. The paper outlines requirements and summarises the main design features of a Pop-11 toolkit supporting both rule-based and `sub-symbolic' mechanisms. Some experiments including hybrid architectures and genetic algorithms are summarised.},

DIS has not been able to support a large number of entities because of its high network bandwidth requirements and the large computational loads it places on host computers. A combination of an agent based architecture and smart networks provides a promi sing solution to these problems when implementing large-scale distributed simulations. An agent system using the remote programming paradigm, transporting the necessary parameters and the necessary code for remote execution [WHITE95], could reduce the network bandwidth requirements and large computational loads associated with a large distributed simulation. This reduction would occur by eliminating unnecessary PDU traffic through the use of mobile agents that represent the originating entity. These agents would travel to, and reside on, the host computer of other entities and provide the necessary state information for stationary entities without using network resources. Smart Networks could be used to create a flexible area of interest manager, allowing entities to specify their area of interest and the information that they require from within that area [HARR95a]. This approach allows an entity to get all of the information it requires to represent its view of the simulated world while eliminating unnecessary information processing.},

In this report we focus on the language extensions (PASCAL-M) and the implementation aspects of the translator. The main departure in PASCAL-M from standard PASCAL is that the programmer has access to the generated code in form of string constants. An interesting aspect of the PASCAL- to (PTOM) translator is that PASCAL-M is translated to the stack-based high-level language M0. M0 is similar to PostScript and has no notion of memory addresses although PASCAL compilers usually produce code for machines or software interpreters with word addressable memory: because M0 completely hides the exact memory locations of code as well as data, we have to use other implementation approaches for activation frames, variable dereferencing and code fixups. Other aspects of the translator implementation like data mapping and heap management are also described. Finally, we relate our work to recent developments in the field of intermediate code and languages.},

We formulate Denning's approach as a type system and present a notion of soundness for the system that can be viewed as a form of noninterference. Soundness is established by proving, with respect to a standard programming language semantics, that all well-typed programs have this noninterference property.},

The accessibility of computation and storage {\textquotedblleft}within{\textquotedblright} the network provides a substrate that can be tailored to build global applications, including those that invoke customized multicast and merge processing. We describe an extension to the IP options mechanism that supports the embedding of program fragments in datagrams and the evaluation of these fragments as they traverse the Internet.

Third, they need to be able to control the way in which resources are used on their behalf (by libraries and other support code). In this chapter, we describe the design and implementation of Sumatra, an extension of Java that supports resource-aware mobile programs. We also describe the design and implementation of a distributed resource monitor that provides the information required by Sumatra programs.},

 abstract     = {Dynamic linking provides functionality that is necessary for secure flexible use of mobile programs but it introduces a new class of runtime errors - unbound procedure names. In this chapter, we present a compiler-directed technique for safe dynamic linking for mobile programs. Our technique guarantees that linking failures can occur only when a program arrives at a new execution site and that this failure can be delivered to the program as an error code or an exception. We use interprocedural analysis to identify the set of names that must be linked at the different sites the program executes on. We use a combination of runtime and compile-time techniques to identify the calling context and to link only the names needed in that context. Our technique is able to handle recursive programs as well as separately compiled code that may itself be able to move. We discuss language constructs for controlling the behavior of dynamic linking and the implication of some of these constructs for application structure.},
