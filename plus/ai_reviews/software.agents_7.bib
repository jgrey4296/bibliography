 abstract     = {An often claimed benefit of mobile agent technology is the reduction of communication cost. Especially the area of information filtering has been proposed for the application of mobile filter agents. However, an effective coordination of agents, which takes into account the current network conditions, is difficult to achieve. This contribution analyses the situation that data distributed among various remote data servers has to be examined with mobile filter agents. We present an approach for coordinating the agents' employment, which minimizes communication costs. Validation studies on the possible cost savings for various constellations show that savings up to 90},

Following a brief review of the various ways in which this problem has previously been analysed, we motivate and introduce a simple formal model of agents, which is closely related to the well-known belief-desire-intention model. In this model, an agent is explicitly equipped with mechanisms for deliberation and action selection, as well as a meta-level control function, which allows the agent to choose between deliberation and action. Using the formal model, we define what it means for an agent to be optimal with respect to a task environment, and explore how various properties of an agent's task environment can impose certain requirements on its deliberation and meta-level control components. We then show how the model can capture a number of interesting practical reasoning scenarios, and illustrate how our notion of meta-level control can easily be extended to encompass higherorder meta-level reasoning. We conclude with a discussion and pointers to future work.},

 abstract     = {Agent-based systems require flexibility to perform effectively in complex and dynamic environments. Previous research has identified numerous motivations for adaptability in agent-based systems; however, the extent of this adaptability can be expanded. This paper shows that agents should be able to benefit from controlling the problem-solving frameworks (also called planning-interaction frameworks) under which they plan for their goals. Dynamic Adaptive Autonomy (DAA) allows agents to control their planning-interaction styles, called autonomy levels, along a defined spectrum (from command-driven to consensus to locally autonomous/master). This allows agents to dynamically form, modify, or dissolve goal-oriented problem-solving groups. This paper presents one motivation for DAA through experiments showing that the best type of problem-solving framework for a group of agents depends not only on the problem domain and the pre-defined characteristics of the system, but also on run-time factors that can change during system operation. Thus, it is possible for agents to benefit from the capability to dynamically adapt their problem-solving framework to their situation.},

In this paper we propose a functional decomposition of problem solving activities to serve as a framework to assist MAS designers in their selection and integration of different techniques and existing research results according to their system requirements. The basic phases include agent organization construction, plan generation, task allocation, plan integration, and plan execution. An example usage of the proposed model for the domain of naval radar frequency management is also presented.},

 abstract     = {In this thesis several control mechanisms for mobile agents are proposed, i.e. mechanisms for locating and for terminating mobile agents and for orphan detection in a mobile agent system. First, control mechanisms are discussed that have been specifically designed for mobile agent systems, taking into account the peculiarities of the mobile agent paradigm. The energy concept is presented, which supports orphan detection for mobile agents. Then the path concept will be discussed, a variant of which is used in the area of distributed systems to track mobile objects. The third concept presented is the shadow concept. This concept supports locating and terminating of mobile agents and furthermore, provides orphan detection for mobile agent systems. We discuss for each of these concepts fault tolerance and message complexity. In the area of distributed algorithms, mechanisms have been developed to solve similar problems (i.e. termination detection and distributed garbage collection). It has been proved that the class of termination detection algorithms and the class of garbage collection algorithms are identical. Using a transformation, an algorithm of one class can be changed into an algorithm of the other class and vice versa. In fact, new algorithms were discovered this way. A similar transformation providing the conversion of either of these classes into control algorithms for mobile agents should allow access to a large number of algorithms for controlling mobile agents. But the failure model of the area of distributed algorithms and of the area of mobile agents are radically different, ruling out the direct use of these mechanisms. Instead we will use transformed garbage collection algorithms to show the following: all the principles of the transformed algorithms can be found in the control mechanisms developed explicitly for mobile agents.},

 abstract     = {This thesis proposes the use of Cultural Anthropology as a source of inspiration for solutions to the problem of adaptation of autonomous, intelligent, computational agents that migrate to societies of agents with distinctive features from the ones of the society where those agents were originally conceived. This has implications for interoperation of disparate Multi-Agent Systems. In particular, the cognitive approach to anthropology is argued to be a suitable theoretical foundation for this topic. Fieldwork practice in social anthropology is also indicated as a useful source of ideas. A pragmatic theory of intensionality is incorporated in this anthropological approach, resulting in a mechanism that allows agents to ascribe intensional ontologies of terms to societies that use unfamiliar means of communication; also, taxonomical relations among the terms in such ontologies can be retrieved, by means of a process inspired by the counterpart activity of ethnographers. This is presented using the Z notation for formal specification of systems, and illustrated on a set of terms from the game of cricket. Subsequently, a simulation of a game of cricket is described where one of the players is unfamiliar with the game, and therefore needs to learn the game by observing the other players. A reasonable behaviour for such a player is obtained, and the simulation offers grounds for further anthropologically-based studies. Further, a study of theories of moral sentiments is presented, and the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is used in simulations based on those ideas. The results of the simulations show clearly the positive impact, on groups of agents, of altruistic behaviour; this can only be coherently obtained in autonomous agents by modelling emotions, which are relevant for this project as anthropologists recognise them as an essential cross-cultural link. Finally, the consequences of this project to conceptions of Distributed Artificial Intelligence are discussed.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents an architecture for an agent capable of deliberation about the creation of new agents, and of actually creating a new agent in the multi-agent system, on the basis of this deliberation. After its creation the new agent participates fully in the running multi-agent system. The agent architecture is based on an existing generic agent model, and includes explicit formal conceptual representations of both structures of agents and (behavioural) properties of agents that can be used as requirements. Moreover, to support the deliberation process the agent has explicit knowledge of refinement relations between properties and knowledge of relations between structure and properties of agents. To actually create a new agent at run-time on the basis of the results of deliberation, the agent executes a creation action in the material world, which leads to a world state update to include the new agent, after which the new agent functions within the multi-agent system. This approach enables the design of evolution processes in societies of agents for which the evolution is not a merely material process which takes place in isolation from the mental worlds of the agents, but allows for interaction between mental and material processes. A combined mind-matter approach results in which the agents in a society can deliberatively influence the direction of the evolution, comparable to the potential offered by genetic engineering. The architecture has been designed using the compositional development method DESIRE, and has been tested in a prototype implementation.},

 abstract     = {A mobile agent is an executing program that can migrate during execution from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. On each machine, the agent interacts with stationary service agents and other resources to accomplish its task. Mobile agents are particularly attractive in distributed information-retrieval applications. By moving to the location of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally, eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and reducing end-to-end latency. In this chapter, we first discuss the strengths of mobile agents, and argue that although none of these strengths are unique to mobile agents, no competing technique shares all of them. Next, after surveying several representative mobile-agent systems, we examine one specific information-retrieval application, searching distributed collections of technical reports, and consider how mobile agents can be used to implement this application efficiently and easily. Then we spend the bulk of the chapter describing two planning services that allow mobile agents to deal with dynamic network environments and information resources: (1) planning algorithms that let an agent choose the best migration path through the network, given its current task and the current network conditions, and (2) planning algorithms that tell an agent how to observe a changing set of documents in a way that detects changes as soon as possible while minimizing overhead. Finally, we consider the types of errors that can occur when information from multiple sources is merged and filtered, and argue that the structure of a mobile-agent application determines the extent to which these errors affect the final result.},

Many application areas, such as e-commerce, mobile computing, network management and information retrieval can benefit from the application of the MA technology. The widespread use of mobile agents is currently mainly limited by the lack of security, a requirement that should be faced when dealing with the Internet untrusted environment. The paper focuses on the problem of ensuring the integrity of agents in these environments and presents a range of solution strategies. In particular, it describes and compares two different approaches to achieve agent integrity. The first one makes use of a Trusted Third Party entity, while the second one is based on a distributed protocol that does not assume any secure collaborating entity. The two solutions suite different areas, and we have integrated them in a flexible support for a wide range of applications, called Secure and Open Mobile Agent (SOMA).},

 abstract     = {In most working and proposed multiagent systems, the problem of identifying and locating agents that can provide specific services is a major problem of concern. A broker or matchmaker service is often proposed as a solution. These systems use keywords drawn from application domain ontologies to specify agent service, usually framed within some some sort of knowledge representation language . However, we believe that keywords and ontologies cannot be defined and interpreted precisely enough to make broking or matchmaking among agents sufficiently robust in a truly distributed, heterogeneous , multiagent computing environment. This creates matching conflicts between a client agents' requested functionality and a service agents' actual functionality . We propose a new form of interagent communication, called functional validation, specially designed to solve such matching conflicts. In this paper we introduce the functional validation concept, analyze the possible situations that can arise in validation problems and formalize the mathematical framework around which further work can be done.},

In this paper, we propose a concept called Agent Programs using which, the way an agent should act in various situations can be declaratively specified by the creator of that agent. Agent Programs may be built on top of arbitrary pieces of software code and may be used to specify what an agent is obliged to do, what an agent may do, and what an agent may not do. In this paper, we define several successively more sophisticated and epistemically satisfying declarative semantics for agent programs. We further show that agent programs cleanly extend well understood semantics for logic programs, and thus are clearly linked to existing results on logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning.},

In particular, we develop algorithms for the above semantics, and describe results on their computational complexity.

The paper introduces the HiMAT framework for mobile agent applications, which models the Internet as a collection of hierarchical domains, where programmable coordination media rule mobile agent's interaction within each domain and locally to each node. This provides the designers of mobile agent systems with a single, coherent framework enabling them to effectively deal with network topology, authentication, authorisation and coordination in a uniform way.},

The goal is to simplify development while ensuring standard compliance through a comprehensive set of system services and agents. JADE can then be considered an agent middle-ware that implements an Agent Platform and a development framework. It deals with all those aspects that are not peculiar of the agent internals and that are independent of the applications, such as message transport, encoding and parsing, or agent life-cycle. This paper presents the JADE software describing its intended uses, as well as being a walkthrough of JADE internal architecture. The main architectural issues are discussed, and the major design decisions are outlined.},

We argue that the metaphors and models used in a framework will affect the thinking of the developer, and will influence the application design. Therefore, usability is of central importance for successful software development, and for reducing development and maintenance costs. We discuss the design and implementation of a lightweight agent framework for interactive multi-agent applications. A lightweight framework is advantageous for distributed interactive applications, for instance applications running on hand-held devices with limited memory. The design is based on minimalism and simplicity. We present the results from a usability study of the framework, where issues such as learnability and attitude have been evaluated. The study shows that minimalist design principles are useful for achieving understandable and navigable frameworks},

 abstract     = {Despite the substantial number of multi-agent systems that use an Agent Communication Language (ACL), the dust has not settled yet over the landscape of ACLs. The semantic specification issues have monopolized the debate at the expense of other important pragmatic issues that must be adequately resolved in the immediate future if ACLs are going to support the development of robust agent systems. After introducing some of the basic concepts relating to Agent Communication Languages, we cover KQML and FIPA ACL, the two existing fully-specified ACLS. We give a brief introduction to their semantics and the issues relating to semantic descriptions of ACLs. We then shift our focus beyond the semantics and point to problems and limitations shared by both ACLs. Questions such as the nature of conformance of an agent system with an ACL specification and issues such as naming, registration, authentication, basic facilitation services, etc., may or may not be (technically speaking) part of an ACL specification, but we feel that the answers and solutions to such problems can {\textquotedblleft}make or break{\textquotedblright} an ACL. We finally discuss the future of ACL standardization efforts and identify the issues that are likely to emerge as we gain experience in building and deploying agent-based systems.},

 abstract     = {The recent development in the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has attracted researchers from various fields with new techniques rapidly emerging. Due to its multi-disciplinary nature, it is not surprising that proposed theories and research results in the field are not coherent and hard to integrate. In this paper we propose a functional decomposition of problem solving activities to serve as a framework to assist MAS designers in their selection and integration of different techniques and existing research results according to their system requirements. The basic phases include agent organization construction, plan generation, task allocation, plan integration, and plan execution. An example usage of the proposed model for the domain of naval radar frequency management is also presented.},

This environment is designed following the guidelines found in FIPA specifications. Therefore, it offers the management agents and services necessary to realize a FIPA-compliant open system. An agent prototype is also provided in order to ease the implementation of domain-specific agents. Even if the development environment mainly supports the C++ language, the resulting architectures are heavily based on the concept of roaming agent through a distributed environment. Interoperability with other systems, supporting other languages such as Java, is guaranteed by FIPA specifications. The presented system has been used to develop a multi-agent system that should integrate the different software modules performing sensory data interpretation, planning and faults diagnosis of a robot working in a space station.},

 abstract     = {The Internet is rapidly becoming the privileged environment for today's Multi-Agent Systems. This introduces new issues in MAS' design and development, from both a conceptual and a technological viewpoint. In particular, the dichotomy between the openness of the execution environment and the need for secure execution models makes governing agents' interaction a really complex matter, especially when mobile agents are involved. If coordination is managing the interaction, then the issue of agent coordination is strictly related with the issues of topology (how the space where agents live and possibly move is modelled and represented), authentication (how agents are identified), and authorisation (what agents are allowed to do). To this end, we first discuss the TuCSoN model for the coordination of Internet agents, then show how it can be extended to model the space where agents live and interact as a hierarchical collection of locality domains, where programmable coordination media are exploited to rule agent interaction and to support intelligent agent exploration. This makes TuCSoN result in a single coherent framework for the design and development of Internet-based MAS, which takes coordination as the basis for dealing with network topology, authentication and authorisation in a uniform way.},
