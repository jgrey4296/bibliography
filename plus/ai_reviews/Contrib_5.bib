In addition, an efficient Neural Network based rejection method has been presented and tested. Due to large variety of Persian surnames, a statistical grammar has been added to the MAP strategy, to make new surnames, which are not included in the dictionary. The model has been analytically formulated and practically implemented. The achieved results show a large character and word error reduction while the calculation increase is negligible in comparison with character recognition complexity.},

Self-regulation is enacted by learners when they form specific learning strategies that they actively or subconsciously adopt in order to enhance their learning experience. Our research concerns the development of a framework that allows for Mixed Initiative Interactions (MII) to help the learners optimize their learning strategies and help them self regulate better. We represent the underlying SRL tactics and strategies in an ontology. We utilize production rules to translate and disseminate SRL tactics and strategies represented in the ontology. This paper focuses on the design and development of the production rules. We describe how the production rules are employed in the context of a mixed-initiative system named MIEDNA.},

 abstract     = {Natural induction and conceptual clustering are two methodologies pioneered by the GMU Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory for discovering conceptual relationships in data, and presenting them in the forms easy for people to interpret and understand. The first methodology is for supervised learning (learning from examples) and the second for unsupervised learning (clustering). Examples of their application to a wide range of practical domains are presented, including bioinformatics, medicine, agriculture, volcanology, demographics, intrusion detection and computer user modeling, manufacturing, civil engineering, optimization of functions of very large number of variables (100-1000), design of complex engineering systems, tax fraud detection, and musicology. Most of the results were obtained by applying our recent natural induction program, AQ21, which is downloadable from http://www.mli.gmu.edu/msoftware.html. To give the Reader a quick insight into differences between natural induction implemented in AQ21 and some well-known learning methods, such as those implemented in C4.5, RIPPER, and CN2, as well as between conceptual clustering and conventional clustering, Sections 15 and 16 describe results from applying all these methods to very simple, designed problems.},

 abstract     = {The Approach Plate Expert System (APES) is a knowledge-based decision aid prototype designed to help pilots fly approaches. During the various phases of an approach, pilots must make many decisions and perform diverse tasks in short periods of time, while simultaneously controlling aircraft heading, airspeed, and altitude. This high workload environment contributes to a disproportionate number of aircraft incidents. To reduce pilot workload, the APES performs calculations, displays approach-critical target values, and uses voice messaging and standard textual output to provide timely information to the pilot. The APES simultaneously monitors aircraft performance, and informs the pilot of appropriate corrective actions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether use of the APES can significantly improve the situational awareness of pilots by reducing their cognitive workload, and consequently reduce the number of incidents during approach. Phase I of this study focused on capturing the expertise of experienced pilots in the rules of the APES. This paper provides an overview of the design and implementation of the APES prototype, summarizes preliminary results of this study, and presents conclusions and recommendations based on these results.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes the use of a modified Differential Evolution strategy that identifies multiple solutions to the numerical optimization of multidimensional objective functions. Traditional approaches to this class of problems, such as Newton's Method, are restricted for use on continuous, differentiable functions; in addition, the solution identified by these approaches is often dependent upon the initial guess. The ability to find the multiple solutions is therefore restricted by one's ability to choose appropriate initial conditions. The Differential Evolution strategy described in this paper is not restricted by continuity and differentiability requirements, and can therefore robustly exploit the concept of sub-populations to converge to multiple solutions in a multidimensional problem space.},

 abstract     = {Efficient multiprocessor task scheduling is a long-studied and difficult problem that continues to be a topic of considerable research. Approximate solutions to this NP-complete problem typically combine search techniques and heuristics. Traditional solutions require a deterministic search of the solution space, which is computationally and temporally exhaustive. Genetic algorithms are known to provide robust, stochastic solutions for numerous optimization problems. This paper describes the design and implementation of a genetic algorithm for minimizing the schedule length for a general task graph to be executed on a multiprocessor system. The implementation is scalable and adaptable to a variety of task graphs and parallel processing systems. Several improvements over state-of-the-art solutions lead to a robust solution.},

This paper presents an overview of the architecture and implementation of eGovSM easing the automatisation of administrative process involving several administrations and allowing the reuse of data. This architecture facilitates citizens' interaction with different public administrations by providing them a single and personalized access point to services. The eGovSM is formalized using a set of XML Schema models in order to support the realization of an interoperable and open system. The architecture is based on four main functional modules: UNICITIDM (UNIiversal CITizen IDentifier Manager) a module for the creation and management of citizen unique identifiers, LEM (Life Event Manager) for the management of all citizen interactions with the marketplace, DM (Document Manager) for the management of administrative process execution and SM (Service Manager) for the management of all public administrations interactions with eGovSM.},

The eGovSM is based on a set of document models allowing the development of a flexible, interoperable and scalable environment: LEM (Life Event Manager) supervises interactions with citizen, DM (Document Manager) concerns the document management processes, SM (Service Manager) manages interactions with administrations, and finally UNICITIDM (UNIversal CITizen IDentifier Manager) represents the manager of unique citizen identifier.},

At present however turn everyday objects into interactive ones is a very challenging issue and this limits their widespread diffusion. In order to address this issue we propose a framework to turn everyday objects, such as a table or a mirror, into interactive surfaces allowing to access and manipulate digital information. The framework integrates several interaction technologies such as electromagnetic, acoustic and optical one, supporting rapid prototype development. Two prototypes, an interactive table and an interactive tray, have been developed using the toolkit to validate the proposed approach.},

The MEMODULES project has the objective of developing, experimenting and evaluating the concept of tangible shortcuts (reminders), facilitating (a) the control of devices in the everyday life and also (b) the categorization of information in order to ease or improve information access and retrieval. The project aims at facilitating the user interaction with multimedia information by supporting both the creation and management of tangible links to digital content. Moreover, our research investigates the opportunity of a more complex, multi-sensorial combination of objects and multimedia information by combining multiple interaction modalities - such as voice and gesture - with interactive information visualizations. In order to address these issues we propose a user-oriented framework, called Memodules Framework, enabling end users to turn everyday objects into Memodules. The framework provides a single platform that combines end-user programming, tangible interaction, multimodality and personal information management issues. Memodules framework is built upon MemoML (Memodules Markup Language) and SMUIML (Synchronized Multimodal User Interaction Markup Language) models, which guarantee framework flexibility, extensibility and evolution over time.},

Interaction with TUIs relies on users' existing skills of interaction with the real world [9], thereby offering the promise of interfaces that are quicker to learn and easier to use. Recently it has been demonstrated [1] that the use of personal objects as tangible interfaces will be even more straightforward since users already have a mental model associated to the physical objects thus facilitating the comprehension and usage modalities of that objects. However TUIs are currently very challenging to build and this limits their widespread diffusion and exploitation.

 abstract     = {This technical report introduces an extension for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are evolutionary optimization methods that try to build models which estimate the distribution of promising regions in the search space. Traditional EDAs use only one single model at a time. However, a single (univariate) model can only represent a single area of the search space. After the algorithm has decided for one region of the search space, the probability that the algorithm can leave this area is very small and explore different parts of the search space are thus rarely investigated. Such an EDA will not sample new individuals in the outside from the learned model. One way to explore multiple areas of the search space is to use multiple models. Our proposed multi-model EDA uses clustering to group similar individuals. For each such group, one model is created. Additional, we introduce a model recombination operator which uses these models to create additional ones. The main idea of our approach is to prevent premature convergence by using multiple models. We suppose that, if multiple areas are explored at the same time, the chance to find the area in the search space which contains the global optimum is higher. By crossing different models, the algorithm gets an additional degree of freedom. By choosing a recombination good operator, we assume that a higher degree of adaptation to the optimization problem can be reached. The multi-model EDA can be seen as a general algorithm model which unites the idea of traditional Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and the EDA. Indeed, these two methods can Be considered as its extreme cases: If each individual is treated as one single model, our algorithm becomes a GA. If all individual are used to construct one single model, the algorithm becomes a regular EDA.},

The extraction of significant reliable features on the road remains the critical step of this method. We nevertheless detect them according to the stereo constraints and an a priori knowledge on the scene. The motion between two frames of the stereo rig is considered as rigid: the homography computation is enforced by the redundancy of the feature locations in multiple views. The method has been tested on video sequences recorded from a test vehicle that was driven in an urban environments. Promising results from these experiments will be presented.},

 abstract     = {Research in the rule induction algorithm field produced many algorithms in the last 30 years. However, these algorithms are usually obtained from a few basic rule induction algorithms that have been often changed to produce better ones. Having these basic algorithms and their components in mind, this work proposes the use of Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) to automatically evolve rule induction algorithms. The proposed GGP is evaluated in extensive computational experiments involving 11 data sets. Overall, the results show that effective rule induction algorithms can be automatically generated using GGP. The automatically evolved rule induction algorithms were shown to be competitive with well-known manually designed ones. The proposed approach of automatically evolving rule induction algorithms can be considered a pioneering one, opening a new kind of research area.},

This approach is a very interesting way to devise a planner based on a multi-agent system in which the production of a global shared plan is obtained by conjecture/refutation cycles. Contrary to classical approaches, our contribution relies on the agents reasoning that leads to the production of a plan from planning domains. To take into account complex environments and the partial agents knowledge, we propose to consider the planning problem as a defeasible reasoning where the agents exchange proposals and counter-proposals and are able to reason about uncertainty. The argumentation dialogue between agents must not be viewed as a negotiation process but as an investigation process in order to build a plan. In this paper, we focus on the mechanisms that allow an agent to produce {\textquotedblleft}reasonable{\textquotedblright} proposals according to its knowledge.},

The aims of the 6 th Sense project are to improve real-time interaction between the real environment and the virtual world and to maximize the user experience in mobile Augmented Reality. To achieve these objectives a generic framework constituted of two main layers is proposed. The End-to-End Adaptation Layer adapts in real-time the parameters of the Augmented Reality system to provide the user with the best possible experience despite the varying operating conditions such as the transmission link and user head motion. The Generic Augmented Reality Layer encompasses solutions to the problem of overlaying adequate information in the real scene and manages multimodal interaction with the virtual environment.},

Emphasis is given on how such an approach may affect the relations between students and teachers, and enhance the services offered in a traditional course framework. To address these objectives, the authors environment is based on a decomposition of course workspaces and provides an advanced hypermedia system for each of them. In addition, to stimulate an active participation of the actors involved, tools for multiple view representation, private workspaces and group discussion have been integrated.

 abstract     = {In distance learning contexts, such as those are being widely promoted and developed with the extensive use of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) some important issues have to be carefully addressed, in order to make education more effective and available. Distant students have to face sound organizational problems concerning the working time-management and the regulation of all the learning process. These are far more complex at a distance because of the difficulties to understand and objectively evaluate how the study is progressing in term of knowledge and competence acquisition, both for the students themselves and for the teacher who is supposed to adjust the teaching process in case of need. Moreover, the absence of clear indication for the student of the relative level of importance of each piece of information available comes to be another key issue in distance education. This paper describes a Web- based authoring system, the Learning Tutor, conceived to cover these issues. The environment is composed by several interconnected authoring systems: �The Course Description, the Guiding Thread and the Agenda\`u, �The Work Plan and Themes Reviewer\`u, and �The Quizzes self-evaluation facility\`u. This model of combined tools aims at providing the suitable support for organization, work and time management in distance learning processes using well documented mastery learning principles.},

Our work has been to develop a formal computational model for forgiveness, to implement it in the form of a generic component, and to test it in a social simulation environment. This allowed us to realize that the social and psychological context had a significant impact on the forgiveness behaviour and the ''social performance''.},

The six contributions have been collected and presented at the 1st Kassel Student Workshop on Security in Distributed Systems (KaSWoSDS'08). We are pleased to present a collection of papers not only shedding light on the theoretical aspects of their topics, but also being accompanied with elaborate practical examples. In Chapter 1, Stephan Opfer discusses Viruses, one of the oldest threats to system security. For years there has been an arms race between virus producers and anti-virus software providers, with no end in sight. Stefan Triller demonstrates how malicious code can be injected in a target process using a buffer overflow in Chapter 2. Websites usually store their data and user information in data bases. Like buffer overflows, the possibilities of performing SQL injection attacks targeting such data bases are left open by unwary programmers. Stephan Scheuermann gives us a deeper insight into the mechanisms behind such attacks in Chapter 3. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a method to insert malicious code into websites viewed by other users. Michael Blumenstein explains this issue in Chapter 4. Code can be injected in other websites via XSS attacks in order to spy out data of internet users, spoofing subsumes all methods that directly involve taking on a false identity. In Chapter 5, Till Amma shows us different ways how this can be done and how it is prevented. Last but not least, cryptographic methods are used to encode confidential data in a way that even if it got in the wrong hands, the culprits cannot decode it. Over the centuries, many different ciphers have been developed, applied, and finally broken. Ilhan Glogic sketches this history in Chapter 6.},

Introducing ready, able, and willing human helpers in help scenarios has proven to be an important milestone in help technologies. In this paper we argue how techniques of mixed-initiative interactions can be successfully deployed in online help. We contend that a well-defined context, that encapsulates the relative knowledge, preferences, and task goals of the helper and the helpee, is integral to the success of mixed-initiative help interactions. We present empirical results to highlight the need for context-awareness in help scenarios and argue how such contexts dynamically regulate the contributions of the conversants, the helper, the helpee, and the help system, in mixed-initiative interactions.},

 abstract     = {This article introduces a novel approach to increase the performances of N-body simulations. In an N-body simulation, we wish to evaluate all pairwise interactions between N bodies or particles. The direct computation of all pairwise interactions requires O(N2) time, which is clearly prohibitive for a very large N. Our approach combines the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) coming from computational physics with motion levels of detail from computer graphics. The main goal is to speed up the execution of the N-body simulations while controlling the precision of the associated approximation, a natural trade-off between accuracy and efficiency common in the field of simulation. At each simulation cycle, the motion levels of detail are generated automatically and the appropriate ones are chosen adaptively to reduce computational costs. The new approach follows the overall structure of the FMM. However, clusters are approximated using their Center of Mass (CoM) in force computations. A similarity measure is used to decide which clusters can be approximated without any significant loss in the accuracy of the simulation. The proposed approach is tested for Coulombic system, in which N charges induce potentials to each other. The preliminary results show a significant complexity reduction without any remarkable loss in the visual appearance of the simulation, indicating the potential use of the proposed model in the simulation of a wide range of N-Body systems.},

 abstract     = {This paper introduces an automatic learning method based on genetic programming to derive local and multipole expansions required by the Fast Multipole Method (FMM). FMM is a well-known approximation method widely used in the field of computational physics, which was first developed to approximately evaluate the product of particular N �N dense matrices with a vector in O(N log N) operations. Later, it was applied successfully in many scientific fields such as simulation of physical systems, Computer Graphics and Molecular dynamics. However, FMM relies on the analytical expansions of the underlying kernel function defining the interactions between particles, which are not always obvious to derive. This is a major factor limiting the application of the FMM to many interesting problems. Thus, the proposed method here can be regarded as a useful tool helping practitioners to apply FMM to their own problems such as agent-based simulation of large complex systems. The preliminary results of the implemented system are very promising, and so we hope that the proposed method can be applied to other problems in different application domains.},

This enables us to have more control on the FMM execution time and thus to trade accuracy for efficiency whenever possible. At each simulation cycle, the motion levels of detail are updated and the appropriate ones are chosen adaptively to reduce computational costs.

FMM is a well-known approximation method widely used in the field of computational physics, which was first developed to approximately evaluate the product of particular N�N dense matrices with a vector in O(Nlog   \#8201;N) operations, while direct multiplication requires O(N2) operations. Soon after its invention, the FMM algorithm was applied successfully in many scientific fields such as simulation of physical systems (Electromagnetic, Stellar clusters, Turbulence), Computer Graphics and Vision (Light scattering) and Molecular dynamics. However, FMM relies on the analytical expansions of the underlying kernel function defining the interactions between particles, which are not obvious to derive. This is a major factor that severely limits the application of the FMM to many interesting problems. Thus, the proposed automatic technique in this article can be regarded as a very useful tool helping practitioners to apply FMM to their own problems. Here, we have implemented a prototype system and tested it on various types of kernels. The preliminary results are very promising, and so we hope that the proposed method can be applied successfully to other problems in different application domains.},

 abstract     = {This article introduces a novel approach to increase the performances of multi-agent based simulations. We focus on a particular kind of multi-agent based simulation where a collection of interacting autonomous situated entities evolve in a situated environment. Our approach combines the fast multipole method coming from computational physics with agent-based microscopic simulations. The aim is to speed up the execution of a multi-agent based simulation while controlling the precision of the associated approximation. This approach may be considered as the first step of a larger effort aiming at designing a generic kernel to support efficient large-scale multi-agent based simulations. This approach is illustrated in this paper by the simulation of large scale flocking dynamical systems.},

Estas caracter�sticas se basan en la integraci\'on de t\'ecnicas de recuperacion de informaci\'on, modelado de usuario e hipertexto. ARGOS hace uso de informaci\'on existente y facilita el acceso del usuario a la informaci\'on correcta en el momento oportuno. ARGOS proporciona, adem\'as, un marco adecuado para el ensayo de la integraci\'on de t\'ecnicas de modelado del usuario y procesamiento de lenguaje natural en la recuperaci\'on de informaci\'on.},

 abstract     = {La funci\'on de la educaci\'on no es tan solo que el sujeto adquiera conocimientos o habilidades dentro del contexto escolar. Por el contrario, se trata de que \'este sea capaz de aplicarlos en situaciones diferentes. Desde este planteamiento, la utilizaci\'on did\'actica del ordenador no tiene sentido si no es por la posibilidad de transferir a otros contextos los apendizajes que se producen al interaccionar con este medio. No se trata de lograr que el sujeto sea capaz de resolver problemas planteados por la m\'aquina, sino que de esta actividad el alumno obtenga unas experiencias y aprendizajes que le puedan ser de utilidad en otras situaciones de la realidad diferentes al ordenador. Muchos autores han defendido este potencial del ordenador y por el contrario, autores como Flores y Winograd (1989) apuntan que su uso no implica que se vaya a producir ning�n efecto que vaya m\'as all\'a de esta formalizaci\'on inicial y es dif�cil que tengan alg�n efecto en otros contextos diferentes del ordenador. As�, a trav\'es de este trabajo se revisa qu\'e se ha escrito sobre c\'omo se facilita la transferencia y se presenta una experiencia en la que se estudian e identifican qu\'e elementos dentro del proceso de ense�anza-aprendizaje pueden desencadenar la producci\'on de este efecto de transferencia, en el caso de sujetos de la etapa infantil y con la utilizaci\'on del ordenador como recurso did\'actico.},
