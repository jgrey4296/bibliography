The ability to price CPU time opens the door for service owners to be compensated for the computation consumed by agents and provides an incentive for servers to allow anonymous agents.

My point is that Social Control - and in particular decentralised and autonomous Social Control - will be one of the most effective approaches.},

We take advantage of the mobility and the composition capability by applying this model to the problem of searching software components in partially-instantiated applications, both in design and run time.

This level of abstraction is not yet supported by an accepted diagrammatic notation even if a number of proposals are available. This paper shows how standard UML can be exploited to design a multi-agent system at the agent level. In particular, it presents a set of agent-oriented diagrams intended to provide an UML-based notation to model: the architecture of the multi-agent system, the ontology followed by agents and the interaction protocols used to coordinate agents. The presented notation exploits stereotypes to associate an agent-oriented semantic with class and collaboration diagrams. Therefore, it can be managed with any off-the-shelf CASE tool supporting UML.},

 abstract     = {The design and development of Internet applications can take advantage of a paradigm based on autonomous and mobile agents. However, agent mobility introduces peculiar coordination problems in Internet applications. First, it suggests the exploitation of an infrastructure based on a multiplicity of local interaction spaces. Second, it may require coordination activities to be adapted both to the characteristics of the execution environment where they occur and to the needs of the application to which the coordinating agents belong. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of context-dependent coordination based on programmable interaction spaces. On the one hand, interaction spaces associated to different execution environments may be independently programmed so as to lead to differentiated, environment-dependent, behaviors. On the other hand, agents can program the interaction spaces of the visited execution environments to obtain an application-dependent behavior of the interaction spaces themselves. Several examples show how a model of context-dependent coordination can be effectively exploited in Internet applications based on mobile agents. In addition, several systems are briefly presented that, to different extent, define a model of context-dependent coordination.},

 abstract     = {In this paper, we present a multi-agent systems approach to distributed event-data processing as it is e.g. pervasive in scientific computing environments. The task investigated is the one of configuration and execution of event-data processing pipelines to be assembled from single computational services (agents) that perform an asynchronous mapping of streams of inputs to streams of outputs, where the specification is given in terms of characterization of the final output of the pipeline. Comprehensive declarative descriptions of the capabilities of single agents in such a system can be shown to be computationally intractable because of the complexity of the mapping between the inputs and outputs of individual agents. We therefore investigate the consequences of circumventing this problem by only publishing the capabilities of the outputs of agents, performing the transformation of output requirements to input requirements opaquely within individual agents, and utilizing recursive runtime contracting to configure complete data processing pipelines. The information loss entailed by this kind of information propagation opens up the possibility of pipeline misconfigurations that in turn lead to runtime exceptions when constraints between interfaces that were not explicitly enforced by the published capability descriptions are violated. We characterize the ensuing coordination needs and related design requirements for such kinds of multi-agent systems and propose the introduction of social laws as a promising principled solution approach to be further researched.},

The goal of this research is to develop agents that are adaptive and predictable and timely. At first blush, these three requirements seem contradictory. For example, adaptation risks introducing undesirable side effects, thereby making agents' behavior less predictable. Furthermore, although formal verification can assist in ensuring behavioral predictability, it is known to be time-consuming. Our solution to the challenge of satisfying all three requirements is the following. Agents have finite-state automaton plans, which are adapted online via evolutionary learning (perturbation) operators. To ensure that critical behavioral constraints are always satisfied, agents' plans are first formally verified. They are then reverified after every adaptation. If reverification concludes that constraints are violated, the plans are repaired. The main objective of this paper is to improve the efficiency of reverification after learning, so that agents have a sufficiently rapid response time. We present two solutions: positive results that certain learning operators are a priori guaranteed to preserve useful classes of behavioral assurance constraints (which implies that no reverification is needed for these operators), and efficient incremental reverification algorithms for those learning operators that have negative a priori results.},

Several interfaces are specified to enable remote interactions between the distinguished distributed components. Apart from Grasshopper-specific interfaces, the MASIF-compliant interfaces (i.e. MAFAgentSystem and MAFFinder) are provided to enable interoperability between the Grasshopper platform and (MASIF-compliant) agent systems of different vendors. Agencies are the actual runtime environments for mobile agents. Several agencies can be grouped to one region, represented by one region registry.},

 abstract     = {We argue for an XML encoding of FIPA Agent Communication Language (ACL), and give an alpha version of it, called Agent Communication Markup Language (ACML), which we have implemented. The XML approach facilitates: (a) developing/maintaining parsers, integrating with WWW-world software engineering, and (b) the enriching capability to (hyper-)link to ontologies and other extra information. The XML approach applies similarly to KQML as well. Motivated by the importance of the content language aspect of agent communication, we focus in particular on business rules as a form of content that is important in e-commerce applications such as bidding negotiations. A leading candidate content language for business rules is Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF), which is currently in the ANSI standards committee process. We observe several major practical shortcomings of KIF as a content language for business rules in e-commerce. We argue instead for a knowledge representation (KR) approach based on Courteous Logic Programs (CLP) that overcomes several of KIF's representational limitations, and argue for this CLP approach, e.g., for its logical non-monotonicity and its computational practicality. CLP is a previous KR that expressively extends declarative ordinary logic programs cf. Prolog; it includes negation-as-failure plus prioritized conflict handling. We argue for an XML encoding of business rules content, and give an alpha version of it, called Business Rules Markup Language (BRML), which we have implemented. BRML can express both CLP and a subset of KIF (i.e., of first-order logic) that overlaps with CLP. BRML expressively both extends and complements KIF. The overall advantages of an XML approach to content language are similar to those for the XML approach to ACL, and indeed complements the latter since content is carried within ACL messages.},

 abstract     = {Agent-based computing represents an exciting new synthesis both for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more generally, Computer Science. It has the potential to significantly improve the theory and the practice of modeling, designing, and implementing computer systems. Yet, to date, there has been little systematic analysis of what makes the agent-based approach such an appealing and powerful computational model. Moreover, even less effort has been devoted to discussing the inherent disadvantages that stem from adopting an agent-oriented view. Here both sets of issues are explored. The standpoint of this analysis is the role of agent-based software in solving complex, real-world problems. In particular, it will be argued that the development of robust and scalable software systems requires autonomous agents that can complete their objectives while situated in a dynamic and uncertain environment, that can engage in rich, high-level social interactions, and that can operate within flexible organisational structures.},

Since the JFC is core to the Java platform, it eliminates the need to download special classes at runtime and is compatible with all AWT-based applications.JFC's continually evolving new features include a rich suite of high-level components and services that are fully and uniquely cross-platform compatible, and offer significant performance improvements. With the JFC, developers can create and deploy large scale, mission-critical intranet , Internet and Crossware applications.

 abstract     = {Agents in dynamic multi-agent environments must monitor their peers to execute individual and group plans. A key open question is how much monitoring of other agents' states is required to be effective: The Monitoring Selectivity Problem. We investigate this question in the context of detecting failures in teams of cooperating agents, via Socially-Attentive Monitoring, which focuses on monitoring for failures in the social relationships between the agents. We empirically and analytically explore a family of socially-attentive teamwork monitoring algorithms in two dynamic, complex, multi-agent domains, under varying conditions of task distribution and uncertainty. We show that a centralized scheme using a complex algorithm trades correctness for completeness and requires monitoring all teammates. In contrast, a simple distributed teamwork monitoring algorithm results in correct and complete detection of teamwork failures, despite relying on limited, uncertain knowledge, and monitoring only key agents in a team. In addition, we report on the design of a socially-attentive monitoring system and demonstrate its generality in monitoring several coordination relationships, diagnosing detected failures, and both on-line and off-line applications.},

Bandwidth, latency and delay may change dramatically when a nomadic end-user moves from one location to another or from one computing environment to another. The variety of terminal devices which nomadic users use to access Internet services also increases at a growing rate. Dynamic adaptation of a service to the properties of terminal equipment and available communication infrastructure is an attractive feature. With application partitioning, an application consisting of co-operating component agents can be dynamically distributed on both sides of the wireless link. By selecting a partitioning configuration based on terminal characteristics, an application can be adapted to the capabilities of the terminal. Partitioning can also be used for adapting to wireless link quality, by repartitioning the application when link quality changes sufficiently. We have designed a service for performing the partitioning decisions, and used a prototype implementation to prove that the communication delays incurred by repartitioning are acceptable.},

Unfortunately, the common rule is that these platforms are incompatible with each other. Thus, agents built for one platform cannot be used in another platform. In addition, they can not interact with agents in other platforms. Some effort is put into standardizing agent communication and migration in FIPA and in OMG but these standards are not yet supported by most of the existing platforms. Moreover, it is questionable whether all agent platform vendors will support these standards in the near future. Therefore, we should find some other ways to allow interaction between agents in different platforms. In this paper we will show that it is possible to make platform independent agents that are able to migrate between incompatible platforms, for example, between Voyager and Grasshopper. In addition, we will describe how to deliver messages to agents in other platforms so that it is transparent to the sender. We will also describe how to build platform independent service agents so that they can be used through normal method calls. Many of these ideas have already been tested successfully in our prototype implementation for Voyager and Grasshopper platforms.},

 abstract     = {Philosophers, sociologists, psychologists, and biologists have studied the concept of benevolence for many years. Recently, researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have begun considering it, but they have chosen a definition based only on the mathematical utility for an individual agent. This definition is incomplete. As a result, many AI researchers criticize benevolence, thinking it contradicts both autonomy and rational theory. In this dissertation, I argue that benevolence should also have a classical basis that recognizes the moral goodness of an agent and includes social awareness. I describe and analyze benevolent agents in multiagent systems (MAS). First, I present a complete definition and motivations for benevolence that is appropriate for MAS. Then, I describe requirements for the structure and behavior of benevolent agents and construct a simulator, called Mattress In the Road (MIR), that can analyze and verify such requirements. Using MIR, simulations of benevolence are conducted, and the results are analyzed thoroughly. In addition, I define an appropriate world where the existence of benevolent agents can enhance the performance of the MAS. This world describes the requirements for the domain type, agents characteristics and structure, environment properties, and performance measures for the benevolent agents. Finally, I suggest some MAS applications that are driven by benevolent agents, and speculate about a more sociable Web as a result of benevolent behavior.},

The research project Monads addresses some of the fundamental challenges in supporting nomadic applications: adaptability to available computing and communication resources that vary in tempo-spatial space and short-term (1-30 minutes) predictions of available resources. In addition to adaptability and predictions, efficient agent communication in wireless environments is a mandatory prerequisite.},

When predictions reliable enough are available, then the negotiation between the domains can be started early enough so that authentication and admission control are already done before the need of handover. To provide seamless roaming even in the looser form between different technologies is much more challenging. In this case the applications need to adapt their behavior to the available QoS of communications resources. In this paper we have described how software agents can be used to provide infrastructure services so that applications have time to adjust their behavior to the forthcoming changes in QoS. Although our research is still in an early stage, the results are encouraging. Modeling user behavior and available QoS separately enables predictions of reasonable accuracy. In this approach, the models are also quite small and simple. However, a lot of research is still needed in refining various models and in combining various predictions. For small devices, the distribution of functionality between terminal devices, networks elements and application servers is an important issue.},

 abstract     = {The last decade has seen an explosion in the growth and use of the Internet. Rapidly evolving network and computer technology, coupled with the exponential growth of services and information available on the Internet, is heralding in a new era of ubiquitous computing. Hundreds of millions of people will soon have pervasive access to a huge amount of information, which they will be able to access through a plethora of diverse computational devices. These devices are no longer isolated number crunching machines; rather they are on our desks, on our wrists, in our clothes, embedded in our cars, phones and even washing machines. These computers are constantly communicating with each other via LANs, Intranets, the Internet, and through wireless networks, in which the size and topology of the network is constantly changing. Over this hardware substrate we are attempting to architect new types of distributed system, ones that are able to adapt to changing qualities and location of service. Traditional theories and techniques for building distributed systems are being challenged. In this new era of massively distributed computing we require new paradigms for building distributed systems. This thesis is concerned with how we structure distributed systems. In Part I, we trace the emergence and evolution of computing abstractions and build a philosophical argument supporting mobile code, contrasting it with traditional distribution abstractions. Further, we assert the belief that the abstractions used in traditional distributed systems are flawed, and are not suited to the underlying hardware substrate on which contemporary global networks are built. In Part II, we describe the experimental work and subsequent evaluation that constitutes the first steps taken to validate the arguments of Part I.},

Thus, the way in which an agent learns or classifies patterns often remains static during the life of the agent. This problem is compounded by the lack of research in communicating subsymbolic knowledge (i.e. knowledge encoded in a neural network) between agents. As a result, an agent may be unable to adapt its learning or classification behavior to changes in its environment (especially if such changes are highly dynamic), and thus experience a degradation in performance. By allowing agents to override existing neural network models for learning or pattern classification with new models in real-time, however, they may potentially maintain or increase their performance in a dynamic environment. In this dissertation, we present a framework for communicating neural network knowledge between agents in order to modify an agent's learning or pattern classification behavior. This framework is comprised of a specification for modeling neural network knowledge, a protocol for communicating neural network knowledge between agents, and a specification of a multi-agent architecture for managing and using neural network knowledge among a set of distributed agents. This framework is applied to a simulated aerial reconnaissance system in order to show how the communication of neural network knowledge can help maintain the performance of agents tasked with recognizing images of mobile military objects.},

JATLite provides a basic infrastructure in which agents register with an Agent Message Router facilitator using a name and password, connect/disconnect from the Internet, send and receive messages, transfer files, and invoke other programs or actions on the various computers where they are running. JATLite facilitates especially construction of agents that send and receive messages using the emerging standard communications language, KQML (see http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kqml/ for the current KQML standard). The communications are built on open Internet standards, TCP/IP, SMTP, and FTP. However, developers may easily build agent systems using other agent languages using JATLite.},
