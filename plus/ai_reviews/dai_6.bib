 abstract     = {If participating agents in a multiagent system can be assumed to be cooperative in nature, coordination mechanisms can be used that will realize desirable system performance. Such assumptions, however, are untenable in open systems. Agent designers have to design agents and agent environments with the understanding that participating agents will act to serve their self-interests instead of working towards group goals. We investigate the choice of interaction strategies and environmental characteristics that will make the best self-interested actions to be cooperative in nature. We analyze the inadequacy of traditional deterministic reciprocity mechanisms to promote cooperative behavior with a fair distribution of the workload. A probabilistic reciprocity mechanism is introduced and shown to generate stable and cooperative behavior among a group of self-interested agents. The resultant system exhibits close to optimal throughput with a fair distribution of the workload among the participating agents.},

 abstract     = {A key concern about the design of multiagent systems is the tradeoff between local autonomy and global performance. If agents can be assumed to be working towards a common goal or to be cooperative in nature, significant overall performance improvements can be obtained over selfish and uncooperative agents. In a distributed and open system, assumptions about a system-wide common goal or about the philanthropic nature of agents are unrealistic. We provide a simple behavioral rule based on reciprocity that allows autonomous agents to effectively share workload with others. We use a package delivery domain to demonstrate how reciprocal behavior can allow agents to produce desirable global performance without sacrificing individual autonomy or efficiency. More interestingly, we show that agents who do not help others are less efficient with this mechanism than agents who share workloads with others. As a result, the best self-motivated actions lead to system-wide cooperation.},

This conclusion can be challenged in a number of scenarios. We investigate the use of limited information by agents in choosing between one of several different options, and conclude that if agents are deliberately kept ignorant about any number of options, the entire group can converge faster to a stable and optimal configuration. We also demonstrate how a couple of coalition formation schemes improves the rate of convergence and conclude that a variable, rather than fixed, coalition formation mechanism is more effective.},

The individuals or the individual groups of the multidisciplinary design teams work parallelly and independently with the different engineering tools which are located in the different sites for often a long time. In order to ensure the coordination of the design activities of the different groups or the cooperation among the different engineering tools, it is necessary to develop an efficient distributed intelligent design environment. This paper proposes a distributed architecture for integrating such engineering tools in an open design environment organized as a population of asynchronous cognitive agents. Before introducing the general architecture and the communication protocol, issues about the agent architecture and the inter-agent communication are discussed. A prototype of such an environment with seven independent agents located in the different workstations and microcomputers is presented. A small mechanical design example is used for testing such an environment.},

In this paper we first place ourselves as an external observer to analyse the possible coupled outcomes of the social reasoning mechanisms of two different agents. We show that in some particular cases, different inferred dependence situations imply that the agents' mutual representations are inconsistent at an agency level. Then, we detail our analysis in a particular case where the agents have the same plans (and believe in that), showing that some particular coupled outcomes can be explained either by incorrectness or incompleteness of mutual representation. In order to do that, we extend our previous model by introducing the notion of goal situation. Finally, we conclude by showing that these properties may be detected by the agents themselves if we supply them with an internal mechanism where they can manipulate the outcomes inferred both by their own social reasoning mechanism and by those of the others.},

This learning is accomplished by recording and analyzing traces of inferences after problem solving. The analysis results in identification of situations where inappropriate coordination strategies have caused redundant activities or the lack of timely execution of important activities, thus degrading system performance. Based on this identification, situation-specific coordination plans are created which use additional non-local information about activities in the networks to remedy the problem.

Plan reuse where a past plan result is reused for the new problem was proposed for single-agent planning and can achieve efficient planning. A special issue for applying it to distributed planning is that, even if the local agent thinks that the new problem is identical to a past problem, other agents may have quite different goals. Another issue is to realize efficient distributed planning, like in a single-agent case. This paper shows that the past plan can be reused regardless of other agents' goals under the assumption that the initial state has only {\textquotedblleft}in-facts.{\textquotedblright} A generated plan and related information are stored as a plan template so that an agent can reuse it in future planning. This information includes generated plans, subgoals, non-local effects that may affect or be affected by other agents' plans, and their conflict resolution methods that were actually used. An agent can create a plan efficiently using a template, because it can skip a part of planning actions, detect conflicts in an early stage, and reduce communication costs. First, this paper presents the planning-with-reuse framework. Then how plan templates are created and reused is also illustrated using some block world examples. Finally, we experimentally show that efficient distributed planning can be achieved.},

Our framework is appropriate for cooperation among heterogeneous real-world agents because of (1) adaptiveness for environments and agents, (2) implicit representation of cooperation, and (3) integration of information and real-world agents.

It involves monitoring the observable actions of other agents as well as inferring their unobserved actions or high-level plans, goals and behaviors. This paper analyzes the challenges of agent tracking in a ''real-world'', dynamic, multi-agent environment of air-combat simulation. An intelligent automated pilot in this environment faces the challenge of tracking the highly flexible actions and behaviors of other individuals or groups of pilots, while interacting with them, and dealing with imperfect sensors and real-time pressures. The paper introduces an approach for recursive agent tracking that enables an automated pilot to meet this challenge, and even take advantage of the imperfect sensors to engage in deception. The paper introduces some optimizations to address real-time pressures and presents experimental data from an actual implementation to illustrate their impact. Agents in other competitive or collaborative dynamic multi-agent environments, such as ''virtual reality'' environments, could conceivably benefit from this agent tracking approach.},

Such a model enables team members to flexibly reason about coordination activities. The underlying model we have provided is based on the joint intentions framework; although we present some key modifications to reflect the practical constraints in (some) real-world domains.

 abstract     = {Team selection, the process of selecting a group of agents with complementary skills to achieve a goal, is an important collaborative task in multi-agent systems. Typically, team selection occurs at run-time using a first principles approach, for example after agents have exchanged relevant information about their abilities, loads, or other status. In time-critical domains such approaches may be impractical. Our work assumes that agents have limited resources and are embedded in a continuously changing world. We provide a mechanism whereby system developers can describe {\textquotedblleft}recipes{\textquotedblright} for team selection in terms of the required abilities of the team, and appropriate run-time constraints. We refer to such recipes as allocations. The paper provides definitions and algorithms, and includes comparisons with related work.},

A basic agent model has been developed and is used to characterize the agents of the MAS. Using this model three classes of agents have been currently identified and incorporated into the MAS testbed. These are: the user interface agent which serves as the main point of interaction between a user and the MAS; an agent manager which is responsible for coordinating the activities of a community of agents within the MAS; and domain agents whose specialized knowledge enable them to accomplish domain-specific tasks. In the context of the MAS testbed we are able to address several research issues such as user modeling, cooperative activity among agents, handling incomplete requests, and inter-agent and human user-to-agent interactions.},

We propose here a generalized tit-for-tat agent model that is completely reactive and possesses the properties of adaptivity and scalability. We show how this (socio)biological model can be used to account for social behavior, i.e. behavior depending explicitly on the interaction of an agent with other agents in its environment. This is achieved through the defi- nition of ''social'' objects or properties, which can be abstract or have a material form, and that are perceivable, accessible and manipulable by the agents. Agents have internal, built-in, or else genetic, motivations to regulate these objects/properties to certain limits and act accordingly. The result of those actions are then visible and directly perceivable by all the agents of the community who seek individually to satisfy their internal needs according to this social feedback. To deploy the potential of the approach, we present three examples from different domains and de- monstrate on several instantiations of the same basic model a variety of social phenomena that derive from the differential expression of those matching motivations of individual agents. The power of the approach may be partly attributed to the presence of genetic variations in the agents' parameters which give rise to intricate dynamics. Finally, we give a sketch of the level of complexity that the system may attain and we briefly expose its relation with predictive systems.},

We describe a theoretical framewwork, based on situations, for talking about recursive agent models and the strategies and expected strategies associated with them. This framework allows us to rigorously define the gain of continuing deliberation versus taking action. The expected gain of computational actionss is used to guide the pruning of the nested model structure. We have implemented our approach on a canonical multi-agent problem, the pursuit task, to illustrate how real-time, mulit-agent decision-making can be based on a principled, combinatorial model.

Instead of using the mouse and menus to manipulate scene details in a virtual environment we communicate with the system by way of natural language. Our aim is to keep the user (designer) free from technical considerations such as planning of geometric details, etc. Taking special responsibilities in mediating verbal instructions, the VIENA agents cooperate with each other and with the user to offer a goal scene meeting the user's wants.

In this paper, we address the following problem: During a communication operation, each agent is unavailable to process new evidence for a time interval (called off-line time). We consider the minimization of total length of off-line time of the entire system. To concentrate on the factors affecting the off-line time, we abstract communication in MSBNs into a graphical model for off-line time study. Using the model, we present the optimal schedules when communication is initiated from an arbitrarily selected agent. We show now the optimal schedules can be constructed in a distributed fashion.},

This algorithm removes the common drawback of backtracking algorithms, i.e., one bad decision in value selection becomes fatal when solving large-scale problems, while its completeness is guaranteed. The basic ideas of this algorithm are as follows: (i) bad decisions are revised without an exhaustive search by changing the priority order of agents dynamically, (ii) the probability of bad decisions being made is reduced by selecting values cooperatively using the min-conflict heuristic [Minton et al. 92]. Although these ideas are very simple and domain independent, experimental results indicate that this algorithm can solve large-scale problems, which can not be solved efficiently by backtracking algorithms. These results imply that the algorithm's efficiency can actually be improved by adopting intuitively natural notions, i.e., the fair establishment of the priority order, and the cooperative value selection considering the situations of other agents.},

Instead of detecting the fact that agents as a whole are trapped in a local-minimum, each agent detects whether it is in a quasi-local-minimum, which is a weaker condition than a local-minimum, and changes the weights of constraint violations to escape from the quasi-local-minimum.

It claims that the different uncertainties of a solution from different expert systems constitute not only a conflict case, but also non-conflict cases. We will refer both the conflict case and non-conflict cases as synthesis cases. The first objective of this paper is to classify the synthesis {\i}t cases, identify the {\i}t types of DESs, and recognize the {\i}t relationships among the different synthesis cases and the different types of DESs. On the basis of this, a computational synthesis strategy is proposed to obtain a consensus of uncertainties in a conflict case. Within this strategy, the conflict case is further classified into two sub-cases, and two corresponding sub-strategies are proposed, in which both uncertainties and authorities are taken into consideration. A synthesis strategy based on neural networks is also proposed in a conflict case. In this strategy, as long as enough patterns have been obtained from human experts, neural networks can be trained to match all patterns. This strategy can simulate human experts reasonably well. Tests have also shown that a fixed neural network architecture can be used to solve conflict problems, with a variable number of inputs and outputs. That means only a small number of neural networks are required to solve all conflicts, thus the neural network can be used in real DESs. Finally, a computational synthesis strategy is compared to a neural network synthesis strategy. Both strategies have advantage and disadvantage and are adapt to different situations.},

 abstract     = {When AI studies autonomous agents, it traditionally strives for intelligence in those agents. However, autonomous agents are increasingly used in areas related to art, entertainment, and user interface. Established fields of art and entertainment (such as film, literature, and theater) depend on believable characters more than intelligent ones. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the AI research community to study a new kind of autonomous agent, where the focus is on believability, not intelligence. I will argue that this opportunity exists, summarize the goals I see for believable agents researchs, and try to explain the key differences between believability and traditional scientific goals such as intelligence and realism. I will conclude with the suggestion that AI's founding dreams demand both intelligence and believability.},

 abstract     = {Cooperation in multi-agent systems can be seen as a system in which cooperative methods lead to an increase of the group performance and thus augment the probability for an individual to survive. These methods give rise to conflicts due to limited resource access and lack of coordination. Specific methods such as task allocation, communication, action coordination and conflict resolution can be used to solve these problems and contribute to an expansion of the capabilities of the group. Organizations, i.e. set of structured societies of individuals, emerge from them. This talk describes many aspects of cooperation in multi-agent systems, and their connection to the process of the emergence of emerging social structures, the so-called {\textquotedblleft}emergence of collective intelligence{\textquotedblright}, with several examples taken from reactive multi-agent systems.},

 abstract     = {Rapid and increasing advances in telecommunications and distributed systems have broadened the arena of possibilites for challenging new applications such as electronic markets, distributed intelligent information services, distributed manufacturing control, cooperative multi-robot applications, and many more. These advances have enabled access to a wide variety of communication networks, offering various means for logically or geographically distributed nodes to connect and communicate. With these possibilities real challenges are converging onto problems requiring better software engineering solutions. As programs are becoming more sophisticated they may collaborate and negotiate with other programs in order to achieve their assigned tasks. To do this they may need to communicate more intelligibly and exhibit sufficient flexibility to build up their dialogues dynamically and interactively. The ability to perform intelligent dialogues is particularly crucial when we have an open system where (heterogeneous) agents {\textquotedblleft}enter and leave{\textquotedblright} the system with little or no information about each other's capabilities. This book presents an approach towards the design of techniques enabling intelligent and flexible dialogues among agents in distributed environments. The approach draws together many ideas on speech acts, cooperation, dialogues and agent architectures, and devises a formal framework to define and specify the major components and the processes involved in reasoning about communication. Based on this framework, the book illustrates how reasoning about communication may be realised in practice. The most important practical benefit of the approach is the concept of {\textquotedblleft}cooperation protocols{\textquotedblright} which provide a mechanism to express various methods of cooperation and structure possible patterns of dialogue in those methods. The book is useful to many disciplines concerned with intelligent systems and intelligent behaviours. In particular it is intended to benefit those interested in high-level languages and standards for interagent communication and flexible dialogues. The incentives for this work, and the literature review material provided in the introductory chapters will be useful to those starting in the field of agent systems and agent theories.},

Agents that fail to adapt and modify their behavior to suit environmental demands can hinder, rather than aid, in achieving group goals. Adaptability and flexibility are key components of intelligent behavior which allow agent groups to improve performance in a given domain using prior problem solving experience. This paper focuses on a particular incremental learning mechanism by which agents can better adapt to each other using problem solving experience. In particular, we propose a framework in which individual group members learn cases to improve their model of other group members. Using these models agents can choose less greedy and more appropriate actions in the context of the group. We use a testbed problem from the distributed AI literature to show that simultaneous learning by group members can lead to significant improvement in group performance and efficiency over agent groups following static behavioral rules.},

We examine the on-line adaption of behavioral strategies utilizing genetic programming. Specifically, we deal with the credit assignment problem of how to fairly split the fitness of a team to all of its participants. We present several crossover mechanisms in a genetic programming system to facilitate the evolution of more than one member in the team during each crossover operation. Our goal is to reduce the time needed to either evolve a good team or reach convergence.},

 abstract     = {Genetic Programming (GP) is an automatic method for generating computer programs, which are stored as data structures and manipulated to evolve better programs. An extension restricting the search space is Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP), which has, as a basic premise, the removal of closure by typing both the arguments and return values of functions, and by also typing the terminal set. A restriction of STGP is that there are only two levels of typing. We extend STGP by allowing a type hierarchy, which allows more than two levels of typing.},

As the user operates a conventional Web browser such as Netscape, the agent tracks user behavior and attempts to anticipate items of interest by doing concurrent, autonomous exploration of links from the user's current position. The agent automates a browsing strategy consisting of a best-first search augmented by heuristics inferring user interest from browsing behavior.},

Among the design issues, we identify the coordination mechanisms and learning schemes used to be of particular importance. These two aspects, therefore are the focus of the discussions. Examples of cooperative problem solving systems, such as a networked expert system testbed and an intelligent agent system for concurrent design, are used to illustrate the distributed artificial intelligence approach. In addition, multi-agent learning methods are described and evaluated, so that some of their characteristics and important parameters can be identified. Such a comprehensive survey is aimed at providing the foundation for building future multi-agent information systems.},
