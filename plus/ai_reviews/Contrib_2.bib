 abstract     = {Efficient multiprocessor task scheduling is a long-studied and difficult problem that continues to be a topic of considerable research. This NP-complete problem is typically solved using a combination of search techniques and heuristics. Traditional solutions require a deterministic search of the solution space, which is computationally and temporally exhaustive. Genetic algorithms are known to provide robust, stochastic solutions for numerous optimization problems. This paper describes the design and implementation of a genetic algorithm for minimizing the schedule length for a general task graph to be executed on a multiprocessor system. The implementation is scalable and adaptable to a variety of task graphs and parallel processing systems. Several improvements over state-of-the-art solutions lead to a vigorous solution.},

 abstract     = {The growing use of XML mark-up language has made a large amount of heterogeneous XML documents widely available. As the number of applications that utilize heterogeneous XML documents grows, the importance of XML documents transformations increases greatly. A serious obstacle for translating directly between two XML documents, using languages like XSLT, is that a mapping between the two XML representations needs to be carefully specified by a human expert. Current research attempts to address this problem by proposing algorithms to automate aspects of XML schemas matching task. In this paper, we identify two major problems encountered when current matching algorithms are used in the context of XML documents transformations. The first problem concerns possible scalability problem due to the diversity of schema constructs. The second problem deals with the need to perform semantic matching. We argue in favour of conceptual modelling as solution to avoid such problems. We introduce a new layered model for XML schemas, called Layered Interoperability Model for XML Schemas (LIMXS). LIMXS offers a semantic view for XML schemas through the specification of concepts and semantic relationships among them. We will show how our model transforms the matching algorithm into a dynamic and incremental algorithm that provide semantic mappings and helps to automate the transformation process.},

This paper presents SPICA, a software development framework for communication infrastructures of autonomous mobile robots. Utilizing the model-driven software development paradigm, communication and data flow can be defined on an abstract level. For this purpose, domain-specific languages and tools are provided that allow specification and generation of module communication infrastructures for communication between modules along with primitives for data management. The high-level platform-independent specifications are automatically transformed into low-level platform and programming language-specific source code. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with an elaborate example describing the design of a soccer robot architecture that has proven its strength during RoboCup 2006. Our experiences have revealed that SPICA is advantageous for prototyping as well as for building high performance systems.},

It is a force-based model using collision prediction with dynamic time-windows to predict future potential collisions with obstacles and other individuals. It introduces a new type of force called sliding force to allow a smooth avoidance of potential collisions while enabling the pedestrian to continue to progress towards its goal. Unlike most existing models, our forces are not scaled according to the distance to the obstacle but depending on the estimate of the collision time with this obstacle. This inherently integrates obstacles� velocity. This greatly reduces the computational complexity of the model while ensuring a smooth avoidance. This model is oscillation-free except for concave obstacles. It enables the reproduction of inherent emergent properties of real crowds such as spontaneous organizations of pedestrians into lane lines, etc. This model is computationally efficient and designed for real time simulation of large crowds.},

Further there have to be a set of keywords and a protocol which define a kind of interlingua. After a detailed motivation, the role of speech acts as a basis for a communication architecture for cooperating agents will be discussed. Viewing them as actions the agents have to perform, the planning aspects will be elaborated. A formal model of communication will then be given which leads, together with the speech act planning, to the communication architecture.},

Especially aspects of dynamics and failures in the production process are insufficiently taken into account by systems in use. This paper presents a multi-agent approach to scheduling material flow that shows dynamic and adaptive behaviour. Even though machine scheduling has found a thorough treatment in AI literature, there are only few investigations on the material flow problem. In this paper, it is argued that a decentralized architecture with centralized control fits well with the local and global aspects of the scheduling problem. The top-level algorithms of the scheduling process are outlined and further improvements required are sketched out.},

Self-Organizing SOAs replace services by functional equivalent services in the case of faults or in respect of quality of service. These features depend on automatic service discovery which provides service alternatives. We enter the WSC'06 contest to present a semantic service discovery system for large sets of services. A recursive algorithm builds service compositions by adding services in each iteration. The search works backwards, since we add services that produce a certain output regardless of its input parameters. A valid service composition produces a set of queried output parameters and input parameters necessary for the composed services. The algorithm is improved by using efficient data structures in our service composition system.},

 abstract     = {Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a flexible software design paradigm for enterprises. The workflows of a company are implemented as services which can be arranged, updated and managed at runtime without interfering with ongoing business. Service management aims at providing undisturbed access to services. Its efficiency strongly depends on a fast response time in the case of a failure. This is hard to achieve since the relations between applications and services require comprehensive knowledge and lack transparency for administrators. Self-organizing approaches promise a solution by automating service discovery. In this paper we present a service discovery system which enables service compositions from semantic descriptions stored in a knowledge base. Therefore, it utilizes multiple composition algorithms from which the most appropriate set is selected and applied according to the size of the knowledge base and the available processors. The functionality of our system is made available through a Web Service interface itself. It is thus applicable in self-organizing service management systems with any number of services and ontologies.},

As a consequence, the problem of finding the right information, at the right time, in a short period of time, becomes more and more crucial. Several technologies such as semantic web data mining and interactive visualizations are nowadays available to address these specific issues. However they have not been jointly exploited. With this respect, the paper presents a novel approach. Finally a prototype that validate our approach is presented.},

 abstract     = {Business processes and their implementation as Web Service Compositions are not only dependent on Web Services and partners all over the Internet, but also on their failsafe execution. Service providers have to obligate their services to perform according to negotiated Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. For example, response time and throughput are important parameters to achieve fast and efficient services. Overloaded or failing services may compromise the reliability and execution of whole enterprise processes.

 In this paper we introduce a flexible monitoring approach for the measurement of QoS in BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) processes. We propose a generic algorithm for QoS aggregation in BPEL processes. The novel generic aggregation algorithm applies customized aggregation functions for QoS dimensions. Furthermore, we present a BPEL monitoring system which supports ad-hoc sensor deployment and efficient runtime and offline data aggregation not only for whole process descriptions but also sections inside service processes.},

 abstract     = {On interactive surfaces, a precise calibration of the tracking system is necessary for an exact user interaction. So far, common calibration techniques focus on eliminating geometric distortions. This static calibration is only correct for a specific viewpoint of one single user and parallax error distortions still occur if this changes (i.e. if the user moves in front of the digital screen). In order to overcome this problem, we present an empirical model of the user\_s position and movement in front of a digital screen. With this, a model predictive controller is able to correct the parallax error for future positions of the user. We deduce the model\_s parameters from a user study on a large interactive whiteboard, in which we measured the 3D position of the user\_s viewpoint during common interaction tasks.},

This allows agents to behave like insects in a swarm, that can fulfil a task communicating directly or indirectly among them. Following this vision of Ambient Intelligence, our work proposes a straightforward solution to coordinate a swarm of robots that have low computational capabilities. All the information and instructions are found in RFID tags that are used as a pervasive memory distributed in the environment. These robots exploit ubiquitous computing to make a formation in space, synchronise with team mates in the same zone, and finally complete a cooperative task.},

These mobile technologies and their wide adoption in the society are influencing not only the way we live, but also the way we learn, the way we work, and the way we socialise. According to [1], there are estimated to be more than 1.5 billion mobile phones in the world today.

 The rapid advancement of these portable technologies is also changing the way educational institutions work. It has opened up new possibilities for extending learning opportunities to all social-economic levels and a completely new dimension to the progress in education and training known as mobile learning. Through mobile learning, educational and training programs that were once delivered only through a face-to-face setting or networked computers can now be done almost anywhere, anytime.},

 abstract     = {The template design problem is a constrained optimization problem originated from the printing industry. It involves printing several variations of a design onto one or more stencil sheets, where the aims are to minimize the number of stencils as well as the overproduction of prints of a particular design. Over the years, exact solution methods have been used to solve the problem. These methods could be useful for small to moderate-sized problem instances. However, when the problem instances are huge, the search space may easily grow too large for the systematic approaches. To date, no meta-heuristic or soft computing techniques have been used for this problem. In this paper, we propose the use of Extremal Optimization (EO) with multiple search operators for solving the template design problem. Different combinations of the search operators are tested via extensive numerical experiments. The results show that EO is indeed a feasible approach for template design optimization. The hybridization of EO with a deterministic local search has proven to be particularly effective.},

We present our ongoing work on automatically creating richly annotated corpus resources for NLQA and on comparing automatic methods for answering questions against this data set. Starting with the CBC4Kids corpus, we have added XML annotation layers for tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, semantic classes, POS tags and best-ranking syntactic parses to support future experiments with semantic answer retrieval and inference. Using this resource, we have calculated a baseline for word-overlap based answer retrieval [Hirschman et al. 1999] on the CBC4Kids data and found the method performs slightly better than on the REMEDIA corpus. We hope that our richly annotated version of the CBC4Kids corpus will become a standard resource, especially as a controlled environment for evaluating inference-based techniques.},

We give a short introduction to Genetic Algorithms. Our new Distributed Genetic Programming Framework facilitates the development of sensor network applications. Genetic evolution of programs requires program testing. Therefore we use a simulation environment for distributed systems of sensor nodes. The simulation model takes into account characteristic features of sensor nodes, such as unreliable communication and resource constraints. Two application examples are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and its potential to create robust and adaptive code for sensor network applications.},

We explore the acquisition of user profiles by unobtrusive monitoring of browsing behaviour and application of supervised machine-learning techniques coupled with an ontological representation to extract user preferences. A multi-class approach to paper classification is used, allowing the paper topic taxonomy to be utilised during profile construction. The Quickstep recommender system is presented and two empirical studies evaluate it in a real work setting, measuring the effectiveness of using a hierarchical topic ontology compared with an extendable flat list.},

 abstract     = {Recommender systems learn about user preferences over time, automatically finding things of similar interest. This reduces the burden of creating explicit queries. Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base recommendations. Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This paper investigates the synergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology containing information automatically extracted from departmental databases available on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems cold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology's interest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is conducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured.},
