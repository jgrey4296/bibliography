 abstract     = {The advantages given by machine consciousness to the control of software agents were reported to be very appealing. The main goal of this work is to develop artificial creatures, controlled by cognitive architectures, with different levels of machine consciousness. To fulfil this goal, we propose the application of cognitive neuroscience concepts to incrementally develop a cognitive architecture following the evolutionary steps taken by the animal brain. The triune brain theory proposed by MacLean and also Arrabale‟s ConsScale will serve as roadmaps to achieve each developmental stage, while iCub - a humanoid robot and its simulator - will serve as a platform for the experiments. A completely codelet-based system ``Core'' has been implemented, serving the whole architecture.},
