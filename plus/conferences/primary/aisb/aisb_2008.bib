 abstract     = {Emotional argumentation is the result of a rational form of reasoning by the Persuader, subsequently translated into messages by applying some variants of the classical argumentation schemes. In this paper, we discuss which may be assumed to be the relative strength of emotional vs. rational persuasion strategies and how this has been represented in a dialogic persuasion testbed.},
