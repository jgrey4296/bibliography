 abstract     = {A general theory is presented for the process and representation of strategy acquisition by human and artificial intelligence systems. The process is characterized by inductive generalization and organization of new rules through successive construction of new problem spaces. Various subtasks involved in the process can be naturally represented by subroutines in a hierarchical adaptive production system (HAPS), which is proposed as a representational scheme for strategy acquisition. HAPS has capabilities for subroutine calls and creating new productions in any subroutine. Results from strategy acquisition in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle by a HAPS program are given.},

 abstract     = {PECOS is a knowledge-based system that constructs concrete implementations of abstract algorithms in the domain of symbolic programming. The rules in PECOS's knowledge base deal explicitly with many details of symbolic programming, including intermediate-level constructs and certain design decisions. Programs are synthesized by gradually refining the original specification into a program in the target language. By applying the refinement rules in its knowledge base, PECOS constructs a refinement tree: the root is the abstract specification, each leaf is an alternative implementation, and each path is a different sequence of rule applications. Thus, PECOS can construct a variety of different implementations for the same abstract specification.},

We first describe the dynamic nature of visual information, and formally derive the optically sensed velocity field transformation (optical flow) for a moving observer. Then we derive the inverse transformation to show how gradients of optical flow uniquely inform about the orientation and shape of physical surfaces.},

Operators perform state-transformations specified by conditional add/delete sets. Meta-operators are capable of transforming the hyperplan they are part of. Specific conflict situations spontaneously activate conflict administrators that use domain-specific criteria to select appropriate conflict operators for resolving conflicts. Both conflict and meta-operators can analyse a hyperplan and make appropriate corrections to avoid subsequent conflicts in similar situations.},

It is proved that undefined(n) can be computed by solving an auxiliary problem, obtained from the original one, by adding new arcs, and of smaller complexity than that one. A class of algorithms for the computation of undefined(n) is then defined. The validity of the model proposed is discussed in detail.},

A new algorithm for noun-phrase generation is then sketched which is sensitive to the conversational state and uses a 'worst-case-first' strategy.

Scenes may be disturbed and may contain objects which are partially occluded by another object. A segmentation algorithm extracts straight edges by multidirectional sampling of the picture gradient matrix. Interpretation hypotheses are generated using 2-step relational matching. A best-first strategy selects the final interpretation using constraint filtering for ambiguous situations. Results are presented for scenes containing configurations of artificial shapes (card-board pieces) and real-life objects (tools). They indicate that in systems designed for application one should sophisticate interpretation rather than segmentation.},

This is achieved by writing procedures in a semantic net formalism. Executing such a procedure produces a network that explicitly contains the control structure as well as the data.},

As such,the rationale underlying the program suggests that it is the object and its event description which form the basic unit of analysis and not the infant's previous activity as argued by Piaget (Piaget, 1954), or the motion or places as argued by Bower (Bower, 1971).},

 abstract     = {A sequence of TV-frames is recorded from a real-world scene. In order to determine motion attributes of objects the segmentation of these (digitized) TV-frames has to provide a reliable symbolic description for each image. The complexity of light intensity distribution along object surfaces in such scenes calls for a method which can extract regions according to various criteria. The algorithm presented here transforms the grayvalue matrix into a vector field, the vector components describing small local planes fitted to the grayvalue image. A three-level filter process uses parameterized constraints to remove inconsistent nodes and arcs from a graph which represents the vector field. Nodes are associated with vectors, arcs are initialized to connect adjacent vectors. A region is associated with an isolated graph component, its features are computed from the vectors in the component. Comparison of features establishes correspondence of regions originating from the same object surface in different frames. These region sequences serve as a basis for object description, especially its motion state.},

To understand a sentence within a given story, we reduce the information it carries, This reduction gives way to the application of a few rules for character behaviour, whose aim is to connect the sentence to another onp by establishing some causal relationship between desires and actions. The system can then answer "why" questions and questions about some facts not explicitly described in the story.The natural language used is French, the program is written in SIMULA},
