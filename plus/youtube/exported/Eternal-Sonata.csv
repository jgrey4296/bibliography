It's finally time, you guys! Eternal Sonata (the true story of the life and times of Polish composer Frederic Francois Chopin) is one of Vasco's favorite games of all time, and one that Tek historically hates with a passion. For some reason Tek has finally relented and the parade of meaningless cutscenes can begin! Today's episode really sets the pace and tone of the story, and really only covers the most basic aspects of combat, but this JRPG will only get better from here!

This episode covers the Path to Tenuto and arriving and Tenuto (plus relevant cutscenes) in Chapter 1: Raindrops.

The tutorial continues as the boys get to play as a pair of new characters: Alegretto and Beat. Think Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger, since these weird baroque-anime children are instantly caught in the act of stealing bread. Today marks the formal introduction to special attacks, as well as the first opportunity to use light and shadow on the battlefield strategically. To top it all off, Tek gets to face the game's first boss in a test of the skills he's learned so far. How will it go? You'd better see for yourself!

This episode covers Polka's first return Tenuto and Alegretto and Beat's adventures in the Ritardando Sewers (plus relevant cutscenes) in Chapter 1: Raindrops.

Now that the constables have defeated their first boss, learned all the basics of combat, and met several playable characters, it's time to finally start the game off with opening credits. And if you thought starting the game after an hour of playtime was bad, just wait until you see how Polka and her new best friend get along in the forest. Which is to say nothing of how the wildlife there responds to their presence.

This episode covers Chopin's introduction, his meeting of Polka and their journey through the Heaven's Mirror Forest (plus relevant cutscenes) in Chapter 1: Raindrops.

After nearly losing a ""critical"" cutscene to some technical difficulty, the boys begin to use save files more judiciously. This will be especially important as they begin to not only collect useful equipment, but also to gather essential items for a central trade quest in the game. All of this an more as the constables lead Beat and Allegretto out of Ritardando to go tell Count Waltz to fix the economy. Based on a true story.

This episode covers Beat and Allegretto leaving Ritardando and entering the Agogo Forest plus the first two steps of the main trade quest (with relevant cutscenes) in Chapter 1: Raindrops.

As Tek reclaims control of the game, it quickly becomes apparent that he's forgotten everything about how to play this game since the last episode. This is especially unfortunate as he gets his second crack at a boss fight almost immediately. He is eventually rewarded for his efforts with the thing he hates most about this game: a historically informative slideshow. Then it's back to Chopin and Polka to try and avoid catching their death of cold (or coconuts) in the rain.

This episode continues the coverage of Beat and Allegretto the Agogo Forest and begins Chopin and Polka's journey through Agogo Forest in the rain (with relevant cutscenes and slideshows) in Chapter 1: Raindrops.

In the wake of the last episode's challenges, Tek buckles down and begins some proper character and inventory management, to survive the dark and stormy night of coconuts. But how will Tek fare against the first appearance of a major antagonist in boss form? If there's one person more annoyed about the weather conditions than Tek, it's Fugue. Also, Vasco partners up with the game to offer consistent insight into Chopin's history (of mental illness).

This episode carries on Chopin and Polka's trip through the Agogo Forest in the rain and catches back up with Beat and Allegretto in the aftermath, also in Agogo Forest (with relevant cutscenes) in Chapter 1: Raindrops.

After sauntering casually through the once doom-filled Agogo Forest, Beat and Allegretto meet up with Polka and Chopin, causing the story to finally begin in earnest (just 3 and a half hours in)! A series of cutscenes helpfully explains for Tek every problem that's existed in this world so he can keep up as Vasco leads our heroes in the mission to tell the king to solve every single problem ever.

This episode concludes Beat and Allegretto's romp through the Agogo Forest, as the gang enters Agogo Village, wrapping up Chapter 1: Raindrops (with relevant cutscenes). Then, Chapter 2 kicks off with another slideshow and more cutscenes.

Picking back up after Tek's month-long hiatus, Vasco struggles to remember the minutiae of the secrets hidden in and around Agogo Village. Then, the constables discovers a way to stop Chopin's relentless attack, and it's not even sick enough to wield magical powers. And of course all of this comes after the game's second historical slideshow, which confirms Chopin's nationality and reveals his favored real-world weapon.

Tek's in charge for the first time in about a month...so there's some catchup back up to speed to be done. Making matter more difficult, the enemies of the Chorus Plains are definitely a cut above Great Coconuts and L'Opera Knights. But once Tek is given a Chance he makes some good progress towards the next boss fight, where a comedy of errors conspires to ruin the constables' efforts to make a new friend.

After some time to regroup, the constables manage to cobble together a strategy to combat the bird-witch-men they discovered last time (along with that person). Theirs is a strategy that would make the military genius of Chopin proud as evidenced by the swarm of cutscenes which attempt to set a world record for the longest amount of time to cross a single bridge. But once they're on the other side, Tek and Vasco may well regret wishing that voyage a hasty end, as Fort Fermata awaits.

This episode completes the first trip through Chorus Plains and meeting up with Viola, then enters the labyrinth known as Fort Fermata in Chapter 2: Revolucion (with relevant cutscenes).

Using something of a treasure map he found since the constables last meeting, Vasco attempts to guide all the Let's Watchers down in Let's Watchville through Fort Fermata in a way that is legitimately informative. In order to make up for this competence, there will be plenty of small combat and strategic failures.

Vasco continues to ""blaze"" a trail at a snail's pace through the meandering maze of Fort Fermata. Will he really manage to get all the loot and escape without getting himself killed? By Tek? Who's lost his mind from boredom? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure: this Fort won't be letting the constables escape without a fight, perhaps to the death.

After spending parts of four separate episodes in Fort Fermata, the constables finally manage to reach its exit, and all of their hard work is instantly rewarded with two of the greatest things in the game. Tek finally achieves a real appreciation for Vasco's favorite character in the game as the weather nearly proves his undoing, but he learns how to recover. Thanks to new abilities, party level and shifting environments, the strategies are only getting more complex and interesting.

Along the way, they also complete not one but TWO more trades for the ongoing trade quest, as well as participating in their first score piece performance session! What more could you ask for? Some slapstick domestic abuse, perhaps? Tek and Vasco have got you covered.

As the party looks forward to an audience with Count Joffrey...I mean Waltz, the constables have learned that they must first waste a bunch of time tracking down a mischievous child. Vasco also demonstrates that he clearly doesn't remember the Forte sidequest, or the Glissando Cliffs, or which score pieces are useful when. Regardless he utilizes brute strength to make his way down the cliffs and save Phil from corporal punishment. THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SIDEQUEST!

In this episode, the Chopin gang handles the remainder of the Inn sidequest between Forte City and the Glissando Cliffs in Chapter 2: Revolucion (with relevant cutscenes).

As the boys finally reach the bottom of the cliffs of tedium, Vasco manages to get lost, prolonging the ordeal. The cliffs clearly take their toll on the constables as tensions run high, and things only get worse when the dreaded Tuba arrives to challenge our heroes. Let's just say this isn't the constables' finest half-hour. Although the team DOES unite with yet another ally, share a Scooby Doo moment together and even discover Andantino's Secret Passage.

The gang finally meets up with Andantino and someone finally thinks to ask why that crazy baton-wielding composer's following them around.

You won't be disappointed.

Today, Chopin and friends are split into two groups after an encounter on Cabasa Bridge, ending Chapter 2: Revolucion (with relevant cutscenes). Then Jazz, Falsetto, Claves, Viola and Allegretto travel through a swamp full of flying fish at the start of Chapter 3: Fantasie-Impromptu.

That should afford those flying fish a fighting chance, though Tek may start a fight if he has to endure one more Unicorn Horn...

The Constables recover from the illness-induced hiatus, only to find tat they have no idea what they're doing, which isn't actually news. Vasco attempts to navigate the long, winding paths and one-way cliff systems by pure instinct, fighting more shoulder dragons than one could shake a Resonating Stick at.

In seriousness the transition to a new chapter means the beginning of Harmony Chains and some tantalizing talk of ""freeing Viola's goats"" if you know what I mean.

Chopin and several children (namely Polka, Salsa and Beat) settle their differences with Fugue in the Agogo Forest, thus completing Chapter 4: Grande Valse Brillante.

What little information IS offered is some sort of nonsensical and inconsistent time travel plot. Don't worry, though, Tek and Vasco will keep things interesting.

Calling on the power of the Sister Brothers (Viola, Salsa and March), Tek decides to obliterate everything that moves within the remainder of the Mandolin Church Catacombs, including the boss, Bo-Peep.

Now you can focus on Tek and Vasco's commentary as they wait for their chance to retake the controls and immediately enter a fearsome battle.

With most of the gang back together, Tek merges some of favorite characters who haven't been playable for some time (Viola and Jazz) with an up and coming one (March).

True to the game's musical motif, Tek plays some variations on a theme in order to get his established team (Viola, Jazz and March) to overcome the third encounter with Pirate Captain Dolce.

This of course means it's up to Vasco to outfit the team with what they need to survive, and he must do it fast as even a basic enemy quickly demonstrates the threat of monsters at this stage of the game.

Vasco fully embraces his assertion that he and Tek are playing in hard mode by building a team out of under-leveled characters: Polka, Jazz and Allegretto. This group fights their way through the Celestra Forest in order to complete the trade quest and open the path to Aria Temple in Chapter 5: Nocturne (including relevant cutscenes).

It's like the game itself is mocking them and they haven't even reached the top and the absurdity lurking there.

At least when all is said and done a new ally has joined the team, much pointing was done and some fancy jewelry was obtained.

In order to stop them, Tek and Vasco return to the conveniently recently introduced warp room and venture to the To Coda ruins. Aside from being a musicall joke that Tek appreciates, these ruins boast a needlessly circuitous method of navigation, as well as a delightfully whimsical new type of enemy.

Still, that won't stop the constables from making it seem more difficult than it is with their trademark style. Plus, on the bright side, Beat gets a new weapon and a crazy new power.

Under Vasco's aimless guidance, Beat, Falsetto and Chopin expand their skills and improve their dynamics through a combination of housekeeping and level grinding.

But at least Chopin manages to reaffirm his conclusion that this whole world is his dream, while Polka receives perhaps the most uninformative fortune of all time from a complete lunatic.

Luckily Allegretto has mastered perhaps his most powerful special attack, which allows him to overcome these challenges and catch up to Crescendo and Serenade, but their quest to meet with Count Waltz encounters and unexpected development.

Nearing the end of the game, Vasco finally implements a strategy that closely matches his typical RPG style. This strategy is immediately put to the test, however, by a trio of some of the hardest regular encounters in the game, predictable inventory negligence on Tek's part, and a team of bosses who resist damage to the point of negating most harmony chain opportunities. Then the constables discover the only way to advance towards the salvation of Chopin's fever dream is to call on some relevant musicians from a more modern era.

After showing the effects of March's newly mastered Midnight Cloud, Vasco takes on an approach that best suits his RPG sensibilities. By teaming the recently acquired Serenade with Chopin and Beat, he forms a team with a high-endurance healing battle style to take on the boss(es) of the Xylophone Tower. If the new team can overcome these enemies' resistance to damage and thus echoes, they will eliminate the magical swirl blocking the Noise Dunes, and let the heroes progress further into Chapter 7: Heroic (including relevant, silent cutscenes).

Starting their journey through the Double Reed Tower of Sand, Vasco quickly realizes that he does not remember this area very well. Since it is quite confusing, the guys decide to enlist the help of an ascii map to make is MORE confusing. Luckily, though, there's plenty to talk about as they get lost, including Tek's new favorite type of enemy, and a game that will be appearing soon on the RC channel.

Inside the twin sandy towers of many, subtle branching paths, Tek and Vasco enlist the aid of more ascii maps, having learned nothing from past experience. As the clock ticks down on the guys inevitably getting lost, they are introduced to some especially delightful palette swaps, including Tek's new favorite enemy. Luckily there are only so many places to go, so with a team consisting of Chopin, Beat and Serenade, Vasco eventually makes progress through the Double Reed Tower of Sand while quickly building levels in Chapter 7: Heroic.

As he takes control of the party, Tek soon finds himself at the top of half of the first of the Double Reed Towers. Yeah, there's still some work to do, but this first tower provides an opportunity for the guys to return the favor to the boar boss by giving HIM the bamboo shaft. Of course all this shafting prompts Jazz and Falsetto to finally address their dead ally while nearly every other character takes a bathroom break or something. But this pity party can only delay Tek's inevitable climb towards the second palette swap boss for so long.

Tek continues to use the team Vasco put together for the Double Reed Tower of Sands (Beat, Chopin and Serenade) as the two work together to reach the top of the first tower. This begins a domino effect of palette swap boss rush and inexplicable cutscenes as the surviving members of Andantino suddenly decide to talk out some feelings in Chapter 7: Heroic (featuring relevant cutscenes).

Have you ever wondered how the Constables manage to get lost and stay lost while consulting a walkthrough? Well today, Tek provides a glimpse into the maddening nonsense that is the walkthrough they've been using. Still, almost despite their best efforts the duo manages to climb all the down one tower and to the top of the next, finding little of interest along the way other than an unexciting weapon and a lifetime's supply of Garlic Dads. At least Tek will encounter another of his least favorite bosses on the other side!

Using the power of the endurance team (Chopin, Beat and Serenade), and relying heavily on the nonsensical Vital Drain ability, Tek wades through heaps of all-to-familiar enemies while descending then reclimbing the Double Reed Towers of Sand, only to ultimatey find Unrest in Chapter 7: Heroic (featuring relevant cutscenes).

It's all downhill from here as we descend the East Double Reed Tower to climb back to the top on last time. Vasco has finally become fed up with the nonsensical maps of the walkthrough and has decided to blaze a trail of his own and just hope he reaches the top before the boys die of old age. In the meantime, Tek can't seem to help bust constantly transition back and forth between various subjects that somehow all lead back to the anime One Piece. With any luck, Vasco will find the final pallet swap boss -- koalabee rematch -- soon, but how do you like those odds?


As various pairs of characters continue to instruct Chopin in how to cope with his impossible fever dream existence, Vasco leads the charge downhill hoping that what goes down must eventually go up to the boss, even without the help of a map. Along the way he continues fending off Garlic Dads and such with his signature team (Chopin, Beat, Serenade) in his quest to defeat Koalabee pallet swap in Chapter 7: Heroic (featuring relevant cutscenes).

With the pallet swap boss rush suitably squashed, it's time for one last downhill charge to find what the flowing sand has uncovered at the base of the Double Reed Towers. Long story short, there's a cutscene and a boss fight so intense Tek suggests it's one of the most stressful things he's ever done (briefly). Tek and Vasco both take turns trying to overcome this challenge, but will they manage to clear the path for their journey to continue, or will they lose and become nothing once more?

Vasco selects a new, ambitious team (Beat, Falsetto and Jazz) and charges head first into an enormous cutscene and subsequent boss battle at the Double Reed Towers' Top Floor Core room. When his plan backfires, he suggests that Tek take a shot with his more sensibly-minded team (Chopin Serenade and Beat). The alternating tactics may be the constables' only hope of overcoming their foe's familiarity with his own body and ending Chapter 7: Heroic.

Vasco's plan to alternate attempts to fight this boss is quickly abandoned as Tek is itching for a rematch after the last episode's near miss. His feelings only intensify as he passes the threshold of betterment in his quest for redemption. Meanwhile Vasco's color commentary has taken a strange shade as a recent change to his job has created a peculiar situation for the boys.

When it becomes apparent that sharing echoes between party members is not a successful strategy for Tek, he decides to switch Serenade out for Viola to join Beat and Frederic. With Tek's leadership the team tries to defeat Count Waltz and his Musical Accountant from their seat in the Top Floor Core room of the Double Reed Tower of Sand in Chapter 7: Heroic.

At long last, many of the game's secrets are revealed as Tek rides his victory from the top of the Double Reed Tower to the base of Mysterious Unison. There, he and Vasco learn a thing or two about how death works as they puzzle out the first main mystery of the unison; what on Earth is going on with Party Level 6!?

After their triumph over Waltz and his accountant, Viola, Chopin, and Beat leave the Double Reed Tower of sand to make use of their prize: the Hero's Crest. Once inside Mysterious Unison, Chopin starts a new band; Frederic and the sister brothers. But the band's meteoric rise to fame changes the game forever and causes a split due to artistic differences, so Frederic partners with Jazz and Serenade to navigate the dungeon of math homework in Chapter 7: Heroic.

It quickly becomes clear that the architecture of Mysterious Unison makes no goddamned sense, and so it's time for ascii maps to fall very far short of being helpful yet again! Further complicating things is the fact that it is very sleepy and late and Tek can't even read the new map he's found until an obvious landmark is discovered. And who invited this Deep Lurker Asshole?

Vasco reintroduces Team Unaccompanied Minors (Beat, Polka and Allegretto) to the concepts of pirates and the non-shoulder variety of dragons as the constables fail to navigate the deliberately obtuse pathways of Mysterious Unison in Chapter 7: Heroic. Somehow they accidently find their way to the boss of the first floor (Deep Lurker), where Vasco discovers he is unprepared for how serious this pallet swap is.

Let's be honest; last time didn't go so well. This time the guys are in possession of a new map, that uses actual imagery instead of ascii characters to show the way, including sensible directions to get to the items. The only problem is that Tek is in charge of giving said directions, and his infamous Tek support may still be in effect. Well, that and the fact that Vasco still has to rematch against the terrible Deep Lurker. Will the constables be stuck on his floor forever?

It's time to get serious as the boys are forced to start Mysterious Unison from square one following last episode's battle with Deep Lurker. Three young children (Polka, Allegretto, and Beat) return to the battlefield baring a vengeance, but only after gathering experience and the contents of most of the floor's treasure chests. Will the aid of a new set of maps be enough to guide the heroes to victory in Chapter 7: Heroic?

Now that deep lurker is dead, Tek and Vasco lurk more deeply into the dungeon. With Tek behind the controller, Vasco gets his first look at this new map and he shares his feelings. As Tek uses his random encounter equation to determine which enemies are worth fighting, the guys talk about jobs and Vasco gives some serious insight to what his dream job would be, and it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect.

Having uncovered the warp beyond the Deep Lurker in the last episode, the constables find themselves navigating a pair of joint floors: floor 3 and 4 of Mysterious Unison. Tek decides to keep using team unaccompanied minors (Polka, Beat and Allegretto), and finally starts to feel the challenge level rising thanks for party level 6. Meanwhile Vasco uses his treasure finding senses and a map to try and track down loot in this dungeon housed deep within Chapter 7: Heroic.

As the boys descend deeper into Mysterious Unison, they realize the challenges so far were just the tip...of Alegretto's literal sword...metaphorically. Navigating the dungeon becomes more complex with each floor and as the distracting treasures grow plentiful. Well each floor except for six...Luckily they manage to stay on track as Vasco learns about Perfect Melons and Tek's excitement about counterattacks in untarnished (though Vasco's wish o study his brain might do so).

With the help of their slightly misleading map, the constables continue their way through Mysterious Unison, ever-weary of more threats like the Deep Lurker. As the team of Polka, Allegretto and Beat blaze through levels 5, 6 and 7, they do not find the threat they seek but they find an enigmatic pervert with a greedy streak within Chapter 7: Heroic.

Tek and Vasco continue their trek through Mysterious Unison as they come upon the functionally identical and highly confusing joint floor combination of floors 8 and 9. While the search for treasure seemingly at random, Alegretto's run cycle causes Vasco some stress, while Tek's navigation skills are tested, leaving him no choice but to freak out.

 Beat, Polka and Allegretto race through the aimless labyrinth of Mysterious Unison as the constables attempt to quickly clear levels 8 and 9. With several items in tow, the boys find the entrance to level 10, where they not only switch floors but also exchange Polka for the much-requested Claves here in Chapter 7: Heroic.

The constables have their eye on the future today, as Tek begins to plan for the final boss and Vasco reveals that a recent conversation was inexplicably prophetic regarding recent news. Tek also ruins the future enjoyment on untold negligible quantities of people by revealing future evens in Game of Thrones, but he gets what he deserves what he starts having face issues.

This episode is all about Floor 10, where the map leads the boys to veritable troves of Scandinavian murder loot! This of course means the Alegretto, Beat and Claves must make the maximum number of rights as this floor of Mysterious Unison is fully explored. But with this floor nearly complete, what lies ahead for the constables in Chapter 7: Heroic?

Tek and Vasco switch roles but the team stays the same as the constables descend to floor 11. Here Tek performs some comparisons between the various enemies around to try and learn a few things in lieu of familiarity with the shifting buttons of party level 6. Meanwhile, Vasco tries to make sense of this new data and inadvertently invents the Beyblade in order to combat their spinning asshole foes. But the whole game gets flipped on its head when a new item ushers in a new reign of overpowered character.

With Tek at the helm, the team quickly finds their way out of floor 10 and onto floor 11, where the guys manage to uncover most of the loot in this episode. Among the treasure is an item so powerful it forces Allegretto to retire from the team and causes Falsetto to finally show the true power of man. All of this as Tek and Vasco finally draw near to the end of Mysterious Unison and Chapter 7: Heroic.

In addition to a tweak to the active team, the boys gain access to the new, deeply unfortunate move that Falsetto has mastered. Will that be enough for Tek to clear the way to floor 12? At least it won't be enough to stop the constables from spending a large fortune to eat with a mute ghost.

When the team (Falsetto, Beat and Claves) reach the end of floor 11 they unexpectedly meet an old friend. When drama ensues, Tek decides to confound the enemy by defying the plot, replacing Claves with Polka in hopes that she may Blossom Shower the required luck to make it to floor 12 while progressing through Chapter 7: Heroic and Mysterious Unison.
