The Spiffing Brit today attempts to play the 2008 classical game that is Spore. A game so unique that it took miracle video game god Will Wright to create a perfect game that inspired a generation of gamers before the release of minecraft. Welcome to Spore! Spore is a evolution game where you start as a single cell object and as you eat, you gain DNA and abilities! The only issue is today we will be seeing if you can beat spore without evolving! That's right the spore no evolution challenge is going to be incredible! It will once and for all prove that spore is a perfectly balanced game which can for some reason be beaten by bypassing the core gameplay loop of evolving creatures to gain new abilities. And for some reason we are able to go from cell stage to creature stage to tribal stage to civilization stage and finally the space stage!

So today I show you how to Break the game by beating it without evolving! It is one very exciting video game challenge! So lets play spore!

If you want a copy of spore you can buy it on steam here:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/17390/SPORE/

What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience.

You know how in XCOM the entire survival of the human race is dependant on your scientists reverse-engineering alien technology in a desperate arms race against the alien invaders? What if you just blew up that technology every time you found it?

Or, put a bit more clearly, can you beat XCOM Enemy Within while only using explosives? If Dr. Vahlen ever shuts up about it, I guess we'll find out.

In Their divine wisdom they gave the players of skyrim the most overpowered spell imaginable and said that they could have it from as early as level 1. So how on earth can a player beat skyrim with only necromancy a skill which is exceedingly limited and has few overpowered gameplay features. Well it turns out that the ritual stone will make a skyrim necromancy only challenge not just easier but it will turn the game into a walk in the park.  You can take a level 1 character and turn them into the most powerful character in the entirety of the elder scrolls universe. So lets see if The Spiffing Brit can prove if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game or if spiff can exploit skyrim and beat the game with only necromancy.

What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience.

So sit back relax and enjoy this Skyrim Necromancy only challenge! How on earth can one english bugger beat Skyrim Special Edition with only raising the dead!! Its the most overpowered build yet.

Today we‚Äôre going to explore the worst playthrough of Dragon Age Origins ever, where the Warden makes the worst decisions and gets every single one of his companions killed throughout the course of the game.  Now there are a couple of characters‚Ä¶ really only one character who has enough plot armor to prevent them from dying during the course of the main story.  And that is Morrigan, but we are going to do our best to rid ourselves of the witch as well.  So grab some popcorn, maybe an iced coffee and buckle up.  Because this is a crazy one.

In most video games you play as the hero - and that is technically the case in Dragon Age Origins.  I mean you do earn the title ‚ÄúHero of Ferelden‚Äù by the end of the game.  But I have been consistently floored with how evil Bioware lets you be in this game.  You can act completely selfish, make the worst decisions and even kill your own companions to become a supreme jagoff.

So as an experiment, I wanted to push the envelope and see if I could get all of my companions killed in a single playthrough.  And to my surprise, it is absolutely possible.  We‚Äôre just going to cover the base game of Dragon Age Origins in this video, as well as the Witch Hunt DLC briefly at the end.

Creating a truly evil bastard starts in character creation.  We need our Warden to look the part in order to fully immerse ourselves in this character.  For class we‚Äôre going to choose mage, so that we can become a blood mage later on.  And for our look we‚Äôll go bald and add some facial tattoos.  Ehhhh.  You see this man, you know bad things are about to happen.  You see this man, you turn and run."

Seven Day survivor. Of all the hardest achievements, 7 day survivor is the most infamous. In this video, with no achievement guide, I don't quit until I get it. I also get a few other achievements along the way.  This will always be the best zombie game.

---------- DETAILS ----------
This playthrough was recorded LIVE on Twitch. As such, Adam is speaking with chat throughout. Videos without chat will be listed as 'Youtube Exclusive'. This is the ENTIRE playthrough, so there will be some episodes in which not much happens, that's just the nature of unedited RimWorld.

*No Pause - Adam is using a mod that disables pause in every portion of the game. This means it is impossible for him to pause with a  key press and the game will not pause during events or trade, making things much more difficult.

** Losing is Fun set to +500% is the hardest difficulty in unmodded RimWorld

Shadow of Mordor is a great game, and has lots of stealth, combat, and ""magic"" options. So what if we took away 2/3 of that? After all, it's kinda silly that a ghost can use physical weapons.

Time to banish Mordor to the shadow realm.

I played every single valve game in a week.

Because valve has a really really incredible back catalogue of games, but chances are most of you haven't played the overwhelming majority of them.

So I thought I'd give them all a try...

Greatbows are rarely used outside of PvP montages in Dark Souls, and for good reason. They're impossibly slow and unwieldy.  But they ARE strong.

The question is, are they strong enough to beat Dark Souls 1 with 100 greatarrows or less?
