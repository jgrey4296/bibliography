"wCZ1VEmVjVo","What is Jacobian? | The right way of thinking derivatives and integrals","Mathemaniac","2023-10-14","2021-03-18","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wCZ1VEmVjVo/hqdefault.jpg","Jacobian matrix and determinant are very important in multivariable calculus, but to understand them, we first need to rethink what derivatives and integrals mean. We can't think of derivatives as slopes if you want to generalise - there are four dimensions to graph the function! This video hopes to explain what the Jacobian matrix and determinant really mean, and essentially why they are actually very natural for changing variables; and also explaining something that might be glossed over when you use them - for example, we require absolute value, and the changing variables function is injective.

In the video, we have only talked about 2D transformations, but the Jacobian can be easily generalised to any number of dimensions you like - you just need to introduce linear maps in higher dimensions! Think about what that means in 3 dimensions for a start!

This video simply aims to introduce the intuition of the Jacobian, and so a lot of things said in the video is not going to be very rigorous - for example, what does approximate mean? It has a specific meaning in mathematics, but we are not getting there; and also not all functions have this nice property of looking like a linear map near a point. These belong to the realm of real analysis, which is well beyond the scope of this video. So please don't shout Fubini's theorem when you see flipping the order of integration at about 17:09.

Hello, this is my first entry to the Breakthrough Junior Challenge, a challenge which calls upon students to explain an important idea in fundamental physics, life sciences or mathematics with a short (3 minute) video. (https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/) (#breakthroughjuniorchallenge)

I was first inspired to research about the Navier-Stokes equation from a passage in the book 'Surely you're joking Mr Feynman', where Richard Feynman described thinking about the properties of water and water flow. In researching for this video, I had compiled a text document of around 5,000 words, which naturally was incredibly hard to compress into a 3 minute video.

"Idlv83CxP-8","Let's remove Quaternions from every 3D Engine: Intro to Rotors from Geometric Algebra","Marc ten Bosch","2023-10-14","2020-01-30","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Idlv83CxP-8/hqdefault.jpg","Interactive Article: https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/


[this video is the updated version of https://youtu.be/syyK6hTWT7U (fixed typos and different introduction)]

To represent 3D rotations graphics programmers use Quaternions. However, Quaternions are taught at face value. We just accept their odd multiplication tables and other arcane definitions and use them as black boxes that rotate vectors in the ways we want. Why does i^2=j^2=k^2=‚àí1 and ij=k? Why do we take a vector and upgrade it to an ""imaginary"" vector in order to transform it, like q(xi+yj+zk)q‚àó? Who cares as long as it rotates vectors the right way, right?

Personally, I have always found it important to actually understand the things I am using. I remember learning about Cross Products and Quaternions and being confused about why they worked this way, but nobody talked about it. Later on I learned about Geometric Algebra and suddenly I could see that the questions I had were legitimate, and everything became so much clearer.

In Geometric Algebra there is a way to represent rotations called a Rotor that generalizes Quaternions (in 3D) and Complex Numbers (in 2D) and even works in any number of dimensions.

3D Rotors are in a sense the true form of quaternions, or in other words Quaternions are an obfuscated version of Rotors. They are equivalent in that they have the same number of components, their API is the same, they are as efficient, they are good for interpolation and avoiding gimbal lock, etc... in fact, they are isomorphic, so it is possible to do some math to turn a rotor into a quaternion, but doing so makes them less general and less intuitive (and loses extra capabilites).

But instead of defining Quaternions out of nowhere and trying to explain how they work retroactively, it is possible to explain Rotors almost entirely from scratch. This obviously takes more time, but I find it is very much worth it because it makes them much easier to understand!

For example, Quaternions are introduced as this mysterious four-dimensional object, but why introduce a fourth dimension of space to visualize a 3D concept? By contrast 3D Rotors do not require the use of a fourth dimension of space in order to be visualized.

Trying to visualize quaternions as operating in 4D just to explain 3D rotations is a bit like trying to understand planetary motion from an earth-centric perspective i.e. overly complex because you are looking at it from the wrong viewpoint.

It would be great if we could start phasing out the use and teaching of Quaternions and replace them with Rotors. The change is simple and the code remains almost the same, but the understanding grows a lot.

As a side note, Geometric Algebra contains more than just Rotors, and is a very useful tool to have in one's toolbox. This article also serves as an introduction to it.

Three-dimensional graphics are much simpler than you would think. I will present the rudimentary techniques for the designs of a simple C++ Matrix library and operator methodologies, through an introduction to 3D Graphics: Points, Vectors, Coordinate Spaces, Matrix Math, Depth Buffer and Rasterization.

We will explore the blood and guts of a C++ Matrix library and 3D graphics. Rather than using off-the-shelf libraries like Unity and OpenGL, we will examine a simple library I wrote to teach myself about the subject. Includes demo of the graphics library/app.

SOURCES and REFERENCES for Further Reading!

This video is a quick-and-dirty introduction to modular forms and elliptic curves. But as with any quick introduction, there are details that I gloss over for the sake of brevity. To learn these details rigorously, I've listed a few resources down below.

(a) ELLIPTIC CURVES

The book ""Elliptic Curves: Number theory and cryptography"" by Lawrence Washington is really good for self-study. It also has tons of numerical examples, making it good for self-study. The subject only really clicked for me after I read this book, so I'd highly recommend reading it.

Professor Alvaro Lozano-Robledo also has a wonderful YouTube playlist which explains all the details of the subject rigorously: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYpVTXjEi1oe1OeAllJpNhFoI4B7Ws8Yl

(b) MODULAR FORMS

For modular forms, a great book is ""Modular Forms: A Classical And Computational Introduction"" by Lloyd Kilford. It also has plenty of numerical examples and you can also code up a bunch of the sections as well, which makes it nice to work through.

(c) EICHLER SHIMURA THEORY (how to go from modular forms to elliptic curves)

The book ""Elliptic Curves"" by Anthony Knapp (see Chapter 11: ""Eichler Shimura Theory"") contains the main content of this video with the integrating and lattices and all that. This is a dense book, but it is really beautifully written. The first chapter contains an extended numerical example that illustrates how to go from modular forms to elliptic curves. I wouldn't read this book as an introduction, because it's very comprehensive and can be a little overwhelming. But rather, it's great as a second pass after reading the intro books I mentioned at the start.

(d) STRATEGY OF WILES' PROOF (how to go from elliptic curves to modular forms)

The book ""Elliptic Curves, Modular Forms, and the Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem"" edited by John Coates and ST Yau has a full rigorous explanation of Wiles' proof in the first chapter. It is very dense, and it requires a solid grounding in algebraic number theory (see the last video in this channel for resources to learn this). The chapter describes all the new techniques that Wiles invented essentially from scratch to tackle Taniyama-Shimura. The key to Wiles' approach was a technique called a ""modularity lifting theorem"". This is not easy reading: it is aimed at graduate students and researchers in number theory. But it is beatifully written and by far the clearest rigorous exposition of FLT I've seen so far.

If you really want to know: what are the 'curved arcs' from 2:40? The rigorous definition is: the ""curved arc"" is really a geodesic connecting two cusps that are equivalent under the action of Gamma_0(11). Equivalently, it is a homology class (with integral coefficients) in the modular curve X_0(11). These are the details you would find in ""Elliptic Curves"" by Knapp, see part (c) above.

A bird's eye view on Lie theory, providing motivation for studying Lie algebras and Lie brackets in particular.

Basically, Lie groups are groups and manifolds, and thinking about them as manifolds, we know that we want to understand Lie algebras; and thinking about them as groups, we know what additional structure we want on the Lie algebras - the Lie bracket.

YouTube, please do not demonetise this video for me saying ‚ÄúTits group‚Äù. This is an actual mathematical object named after a French mathematician Jacques Tits.

Around 11:50, can't imagine that this error got in - it should have been SU(n) = {U in U(n), det U = 1}.

Orthogonal and unitary groups. Rotational symmetries, real and complex, are particularly useful in the field of Lie theory, because their (complexified) Lie algebras, together with that of the symplectic group Sp(n), are the only infinite families of simple Lie algebras. This video is to familiarise with the SO(n), SU(n) notations, and provides further motivation to study Lie theory.

"g4ecBFmvAYU","The deeper meaning of matrix transpose","Mathemaniac","2023-10-14","2022-12-06","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g4ecBFmvAYU/hqdefault.jpg","100k Q&A: https://forms.gle/dHnWwszzfHUqFKny7

Transpose isn‚Äôt just swapping rows and columns - it‚Äôs more about changing perspective to get the same measurements. By understanding the general idea of transpose of a linear map, we can use it to visualise transpose much more directly. We will also heavily rely on the concept of covectors, and touch lightly on metric tensors in special/general relativity, and adjoints in quantum mechanics.

As far as I know, this way of visualisation of transpose is original. Most people use SVD (singular value decomposition) for such visualisation, but I think it is much less direct than this one, and also SVD is mostly used for numerical methods, so it feels somewhat unnatural to use a numerical method to explain linear transformations (though, of course, SVD is extremely useful). Please let me know if you know that other people have this specific visualisation.

The concept I am introducing here is usually called a ‚Äúpullback‚Äù (and actually the original linear transformation would be called ‚Äúpushforward‚Äù), but as said in the video, another way of thinking about transpose is the notion of ‚Äúadjoint‚Äù.

Notes:
(1) I am calling covectors a ‚Äúmeasuring device‚Äù, not only because the level set representation of covectors looks like a ruler when you take a strip of the plane, but also because of its connections with quantum mechanics. A ‚Äúbra‚Äù in quantum mechanics is a covector, and can be thought of as a ‚Äúmeasurement‚Äù, in the sense of ‚Äúhow likely will you measure that state‚Äù (sort of).

(2) I deliberately don‚Äôt use row vectors to describe covectors, not only because this only works in finite-dimensional spaces, but also because it is awkward for the ordering when we say a transpose matrix *acts* on the covector. We usually apply transformations on the *left*, but if you treat the covector as a row vector, you have to act the transpose matrix on the *right*.

(3) You can do the sort of ‚Äúexercise‚Äù to verify this visualisation of transpose for all (non-singular) matrices, but I think the algebra is slightly too tedious. This is the reason why I spent a lot of time talking about the big picture of transpose - to make the explanation as natural as possible.

""A drunk man will find his way home, but a drunk bird may get lost forever."" What is this sentence about?

In 2D, the random walk is ""recurrent"", i.e. you are guaranteed to go back to where you started; but in 3D, the random walk is ""transient"", the opposite of ""recurrent"". In fact, for the 2D case, that also means that you are guaranteed to go to ALL places in the world (the only constraint is, of course, time). [Think about why.]

Markov chains are also an important tool in modelling the real world, and so I feel like this is a good excuse for bringing it up.

At the end, I also compare this phenomenon to Stein's paradox - in both cases, there is a cutoff between 2 and 3 dimensions, and they have similar intuitive explanation - is that a coincidence?

For a long time, I thought it was just my dream, but actually, it is not!

This proof only uses very elementary methods, and depending on your definition of calculus, doesn't actually use calculus. The most we are using is a limiting process, and definitely no differentiation or integration here.

This proof is very beautiful - not only that it unveils the geometric meaning of each term in the series very beautifully, but also understandable by a normal high-school student with a little bit of patience. I am very surprised that it has not appeared on YouTube before, and even if it does exist on the internet, it is far too unpopular, and so I have to bring this up!

Obviously this is not my proof. See the sources below.

This is the start of a series on complex analysis, which focuses on the visual insights rather than the more traditional rigorous approach, so it is not very likely that we will touch upon more advanced, yet very remarkable theorems in complex analysis, like Riemann mapping theorem, or the Picard's theorems. This is more likely of more use to the applied mathematicians, physicists and engineers, at least in the first few videos, simply because the interesting theorems are most likely pushed towards the end, and grouped as ""applications of complex analysis"", like FTA and RH.

This is only currently my plan, and things are likely to change, but hopefully this is the backbone of what's coming next. I might not be uploading like weekly, but hopefully as frequently as I hope.

Beautiful pictorial summary by @ThuyNganVu:
https://twitter.com/ThuyNganVu/status/1259288683489849344

Errors:
At minute 16, the sum should be written with a ""..."" to indicate going to infinity.
At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation.
At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!.
At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.  Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.

Not familiar with the calculus referenced in this video?  Try taking a look at this one:
https://youtu.be/m2MIpDrF7Es

Another perspective on this formula, from Mathologer:
https://youtu.be/-dhHrg-KbJ0

Another perspective from this channel:
https://youtu.be/mvmuCPvRoWQ

And yet another from the blog Better Explained:
https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/

I'm not sure where the perspective shown in this video originates.  I do know you can find it in Tristan Needham's excellent book ""Visual Complex Analysis"", but if anyone has a sense of the first occurrence of this intuition do feel free to share.  It's simple and natural enough, though, that it's probably a view which has been independently thought up many times over.
