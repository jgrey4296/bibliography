Welcome to my Let's Play of The Old City: Leviathan, a narrative-focused game from PostMod Softworks where you play an isolationist living in the outskirts of a decaying city from a civilization long past.

For those unfamiliar with what I do, let me introduce the kind of videos I make. I usually take my time and absorb everything I can from the games I play. I also like to examine them; I'll often talk about how the game is affecting me, what I think of it, what works, what doesn't work, and game design. So my videos are typically a mixture of Let's Play, criticism, and examination. I suppose you could say I'm an analytical let's player. I'm no expert, but I love games and I view every game as a new piece of art waiting to be explored.

I also like to examine them; I'll often talk about how the game is affecting me, what I think of it, what works, what doesn't work, and game design.

The life you save could be your own! (I don't actually know if our character is in any danger. I just thought that would sound cool.)

We worked hard on this video, it's the result of 3 months worth of nonstop work. So please give a big thank you to all the members on my team for helping me make this video happen. It's been a big dream of mine to do pokemon nuzlockes for youtube, and I would watch them all the time even before I had my own channel. So being able to make this video, even if it is a bit out of the ordinary for my channel, is so awesome and I'm really happy I was finally able to."

It is also feature-length. Literally the length of numerous good films you could watch instead. Oops!

Message to artists

I tried very hard to credit ever artist featured, but do to some deleted blogs/ how viral some of these images are, it was occasionally not possible to find a proper source, and theres a chance some of these images could be credited to a blog that featured them as opposed to the artists account themselves. If you see your art in this video uncredited, you can either email my business email (found on my twitter) or reply to the announcement tweet of this video, and we will get you properly credited.

More about Hydroneer (from Steam):

Hydroneer is a mining sandbox game where you dig for gold and other resources to build massive mining machines and a base of operation. Use primitive tools, hydro-powered machines, and player-built structures to dig and evolve your operation in this tycoon-style progression system.

Using a state-of-the-art voxel based terrain system, you can create cave networks, quarry pits, or even mud mountains. Discover relics of the past in the depths of Hydroneer, with better rewards the deeper you dig.

Hydroneer features a dynamic modular system for building structures and hydro powered machinery. Create the base of operations from your own design to optimise your work. Create networks of hydro pipes, control pressure. Craft resources, weaponry, and jewellery.

Rigs are large hydro powered machines used for a variety of uses, from digging resources to transporting goods.

Various parcels of land await you in the world of Hydroneer, each with their own advantages. Deeper pits, attractive scenery, and closer stores. You decide where to build your base of operations."

About This Game

Design and build your own hospital!

Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful – or functional – healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County.

Optimize your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible.

Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in.

Cure unusual illnesses

Don’t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine.

Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. You can handle a single patient – but can you handle a Pandemic?

Once you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut.

Improve and expand your hospital horizons!

Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next?

Once you’ve cured the residents of a small harbor village, can you take on a bigger challenge in a busier hospital?

Improve your facilities, upgrade machines, staff and layouts to make more money, more quickly.

Train and improve your staff, leveling them up with new skills and abilities to make your hospital even more efficient.

Make use of the extensive statistic and information screens to analyse your strengths and weaknesses, and make rapid alterations. Adjust the price of your treatments, keep an eye on your turnover, take out loans and optimize your earnings.

You’ll be managing staff with unique personality types and traits, so you’ll need to keep an eye on who’s being efficient – and who is just a pain in the neck. Balance your workforce with your ambitions as you strive to make profit (and hopefully save some people along the way)."

Your Inn will soon attract the attention of important political and military figures, who are desperately trying to hold on to the reins of power. Gamers will become part of a large-scale drama full of political intrigues, vivid characters, treacherous NPC’s and dangerous quests inspired by RPG games – You will even have a damsel in distress to save!

More about Buoyancy (from Steam):

Buoyancy is a city-building strategy game set in an ocean world.

Build a floating city. Plan out your city's expansion by placing floating platforms that connect with each other. There are several types of buildings: Gatherers, Production, Hunters, Military, and Utility. Resources are delivered in real-time for constructing and production by your villagers.

Manage a growing population. Your city's population will be ever growing! Manage your villagers happiness and nourishment levels to keep them alive. Try to balance resource production with an increasing population that demands more and more. Combat sickness and fires that could cripple your city.

Explore with your mighty city. In this ocean world there are resources and floating junk to exploit but they’re not always going to drift your way. You can move your city around to exploit resources providing your buildings a production boost. Most of these resources are critical to develop larger cities, and some are necessary to keep surviving!
Find schools of fish, derelict ships, and take advantage of rebounded whale populations (or don’t).

Fight for your survival. Pirates will attack you if they spot your city. You can train Guards to defend your city from invaders. Place Junk Cannons to destroy a large amount of pirates in one blow, but be careful of friendly fire!

More about Fantasy Blacksmith (from Steam):

You are a blacksmith in the world of the sword, magic and war, in which any blacksmith who knows how to make even the simplest swords is in demand. You start off as a poor unskilled blacksmith, but in time you will gain experience and improve to achieve wealth, fame and power, and change this world!

Fantasy Blacksmith is a magically realistic blacksmith simulator in which you have to create and sell weapons. Also, your smith will gain more experience and become stronger and more accurate with each created sword. You can also improve your equipment in the smithy, buy a better forge, better grindstone, improve your hammer and etc. We want to create an exciting and interesting simulator in which any player can make his dream sword. We are developing the game and creating 3D models from scratch. From the finished content, we take the textures and effects, and then we rework most of them.

""You are a smith and you create swords!""
The creation of the sword begins with the drawing. The sword consists of 8 parts: Blade (5 parts), Cross-guard, Handle, Top. You choose the material from which the sword will be made. It can be iron, bronze, titan, tungsten, mithril, silver, gold, etc. Using the large number of options offered and your imagination, you can create a huge number of unique swords. We believe that there may be more than 10 billion different swords that you can create.

""Using a hammer, beat your ingot into a blade""
According to your drawing, you will be hammering the red-hot metal to give it the shape of a blade.

You also need to remember to keep the metal temperature high, if it cools down, you can not forge it.
""Finally I can make Damascus steel""
You will have the opportunity to practice alchemy. Using different chemical mixtures of the correct recipe, you can create a damask pattern on your sword. Depending on the proportion of the mix of the chemical elements, and on the heating and holding the mixture, the result will depend.

""Feel yourself a witch""
One of the most interesting parts of the gameplay is making a magic potion. This is a very exciting and dangerous process. Having done everything correctly you will get a new sword from the mythical material, but if you make a mistake you can spoil the sword or even destroy it.

In the game there will be a lot of ingredients for the magical boiler and by collecting everything by recipe, you will get many different potions.
""Long live runic magic""
To superimpose magic effects on weapons, runes will be used, depending on the pattern on the magic table, different spells will be cast on the weapon.

""Casino in the Forge""
We will add a few mini-games for a variety of gameplay. Currently, dice and darts are being developed. Also artificial intelligence of rivals will be added. In mini-games you can try to sell your goods at an inflated price or play for money or rare artifacts with visitors to your forge.

Note: A key was provided.

Ahh, Far Cry 3. An open-world jungle hellscape. A pirate-island simulator. Skyrim, but with guns.

I've only ever finished this game once, and I don't remember all that much from it, but I do remember one thing: Far Cry 3 has a flamethrower. And probably other methods of making flames as well.

So with that in mind, I've only got one question:

Game Description:

You awake in a nightmarish carnival and watch a golden-haired woman hurl herself down a bottomless well for your sake. You seek clues and help from jeering ravens, an eyeless scribe, a living furnace, a mismade mermaid, and many more who dwell within the park. All the while, a shadow shrieks from atop a towering roller-coaster, and you know that until you destroy this Dark Thing, the woman will keep jumping, falling, and dying, over and over again....

SUMMARY

Strangeland is a classic point-and-click adventure that integrates a compelling narrative with engaging puzzles. For almost a decade, we've been working on a worthy successor to the fan-acclaimed Primordia, and we are proud, at long last, to share our second game.

Strangeland is a place like no other. Even in the real world, carnivals occupy a twilight territory between the fantastic and the mundane, the alien and the familiar. In their funhouse mirrors, their freaks, and their frauds, we see hideous and haunting reflections of ourselves, and we witness the wonder and horror of humanity in just a few frayed tents, peeling circus wagons, dingy booths, and run-down rides. Strangeland, of course, is most definitely not the real world. Indeed, figuring out where—and who—you are is one of the game's many mysteries.

As you explore Strangeland, you will need to gather otherworldly tools and win strange allies to overcome a daunting array of obstacles. Forge a blade from iron stolen from the jaws of a ravenous hound and hone it with wrath and grief; charm the eye out of a ten-legged teratoma; and ride a giant cicada to the edge of oblivion.... Amidst such madness, death itself has no grip on you, and you will wield that slippery immortality to gain an edge over your foes.

Navigating this domain of monsters and metaphors will require understanding its denizens and its enigmas. Unlike many adventure games that offer a linear experience and single-solution puzzles, Strangeland lets you pick your own way, your own approach, and your own meaning—one player might win a carnival game with sharpshooting, another by electrical engineering; one player might unravel a strange prophet's wordplay while another gathers visual clues scattered throughout the environment. Ultimately, Strangeland's story will be your story. You are not the audience; you are the player.

KEY FEATURES

Approximately five hours of gameplay, replayable thanks to different choices, different puzzle solutions, and different endings

Breathtaking pixel art in twice Primordia's resolution (640x360—party like it's 1999!)

Dozens of rooms to explore, with variant versions as the carnival grows ever more twisted

An eccentric cast, including a sideshow freak, a telepathic starfish, an animatronic fortune-teller, and a trio of masqueraders

Full, professional voice over and hours of original music

A rich, thematic story about identity, loss, self-doubt, and redemption

Integrated, in-character hint system (optional, of course)

Hours of developer commentary and an ""annotation mode"" (providing on-screen explanations for the references woven throughout the game)"

Game Description:

You awake in a nightmarish carnival and watch a golden-haired woman hurl herself down a bottomless well for your sake. You seek clues and help from jeering ravens, an eyeless scribe, a living furnace, a mismade mermaid, and many more who dwell within the park. All the while, a shadow shrieks from atop a towering roller-coaster, and you know that until you destroy this Dark Thing, the woman will keep jumping, falling, and dying, over and over again....

SUMMARY

Strangeland is a classic point-and-click adventure that integrates a compelling narrative with engaging puzzles. For almost a decade, we've been working on a worthy successor to the fan-acclaimed Primordia, and we are proud, at long last, to share our second game.

Strangeland is a place like no other. Even in the real world, carnivals occupy a twilight territory between the fantastic and the mundane, the alien and the familiar. In their funhouse mirrors, their freaks, and their frauds, we see hideous and haunting reflections of ourselves, and we witness the wonder and horror of humanity in just a few frayed tents, peeling circus wagons, dingy booths, and run-down rides. Strangeland, of course, is most definitely not the real world. Indeed, figuring out where—and who—you are is one of the game's many mysteries.

As you explore Strangeland, you will need to gather otherworldly tools and win strange allies to overcome a daunting array of obstacles. Forge a blade from iron stolen from the jaws of a ravenous hound and hone it with wrath and grief; charm the eye out of a ten-legged teratoma; and ride a giant cicada to the edge of oblivion.... Amidst such madness, death itself has no grip on you, and you will wield that slippery immortality to gain an edge over your foes.

Navigating this domain of monsters and metaphors will require understanding its denizens and its enigmas. Unlike many adventure games that offer a linear experience and single-solution puzzles, Strangeland lets you pick your own way, your own approach, and your own meaning—one player might win a carnival game with sharpshooting, another by electrical engineering; one player might unravel a strange prophet's wordplay while another gathers visual clues scattered throughout the environment. Ultimately, Strangeland's story will be your story. You are not the audience; you are the player.

KEY FEATURES

Approximately five hours of gameplay, replayable thanks to different choices, different puzzle solutions, and different endings

Breathtaking pixel art in twice Primordia's resolution (640x360—party like it's 1999!)

Dozens of rooms to explore, with variant versions as the carnival grows ever more twisted

An eccentric cast, including a sideshow freak, a telepathic starfish, an animatronic fortune-teller, and a trio of masqueraders

Game Description:

Something's rotten in the land of the dead, and you're being played for a sucker. Meet Manny Calavera, travel agent at the Department of Death. He sells luxury packages to souls on their four-year journey to eternal rest. But there's trouble in paradise. Help Manny untangle himself from a conspiracy that threatens his very salvation.

One of the most acclaimed adventure games of all time is now back, better than ever. Grim Fandango's epic story of four years in the life (or death) of Manny Calavera, travel agent to the dead, has been remastered to look, sound, and control even better than when it won GameSpot's Game of the Year award upon its original launch. Grim Fandango still stands as a classic of the genre, with unforgettable characters and unique combination of film noir and Mexican folklore.

Remastered version includes

Repainted, hi-res character textures

New, dynamic lighting

Classic score re-recorded with a full live orchestra

Over 2 hours of exclusive developer commentary

Concept art browser

Game Description:

Life has ceased. Man is but a myth. And now, even the machines have begun to fail. Lead Horatio Nullbuilt and his sarcastic sidekick Crispin on a journey through the crumbling world of Primordia, facing malfunctioning robots, ancient secrets, and an implacable, power-hungry foe.

What Happened to the Humans?

Set in a post-apocalyptic world strewn with cast-off machines, Primordia tells the story of Horatio Nullbuilt, a stoic robot who values his solitude and independence. Horatio spends his days studying the Book of Man, sparring with his droid companion Crispin, and tinkering with the airship they call home — a peaceful existence that becomes threatened when a rogue robot steals the energy source that the pair needs to survive.

When Horatio and Crispin’s search for energy brings them to the dazzling city of Metropol, the simple quest to recover their stolen power core leads to unexpected discoveries about Horatio’s origins and a new understanding of the legendary humans who walked the earth before him.

Key Features

An epic storyline about the extinction of the human race

Voiceover work starring fan favorite Logan Cunningham

Optional puzzles - learn more about the world the more you play"

When Horatio and Crispin’s search for energy brings them to the dazzling city of Metropol, the simple quest to recover their stolen power core leads to unexpected discoveries about Horatio’s origins and a new understanding of the legendary humans who walked the earth before him.

Game Description:

Maize is a first-person adventure game about what happens when two scientists misinterpret a memo from the U.S. Government and create sentient corn. And that last sentence is pretty much the least ridiculous thing about the game.

Explore an abandoned farm and a not-so-abandoned underground research facility as you uncover the mysteries around Maize, and possibly learn a bit about yourself along the way. Or maybe not.

With a colourful cast of characters and an absolutely absurd world, Maize offers up a unique experience that keeps the surprises coming. Seriously, they’re everywhere.
FEATURES

Immerse yourself and explore Maize’s fully-realized environment,featuring a cornucopia of areas to explore (see what we did there?)

Solve environmental puzzles that get more and more absurd the further you delve into the adventure

Uncover the secrets of Maize’s world, as you try and figure out what it is the corn really want, aside from a very good nap

Meet some friends and enemies along the way, which include a very small grumpy Russian robot bear and an unhinged corn stalk who’s a bit of a jerk"

Game Description:

The world ended on the day the bombs fell. Since then, it’s always been like this: disease, hunger, death. The ruling Aristocrats — a faceless oligarchy that controls all resources — have unchallenged authority. There’s never enough food, water, or vaccine to go around. The rich receive regular doses of vaccinations in exchange for their unconditional government support. The poor live in fear, superstition, and squalor until they die.

Amy Wellard, a young woman reluctantly working for the government to qualify for the vaccine lottery, believes there’s a cure — and she’s going to find it. Even if it costs her her life.

Over the course of five hours, the video tries to figure out how the games support or detract from one another, the ways they're connected, and how a clumsy fool like me can find not only victory but comfort in their strange, sad little worlds.

Note to Subscribers: I know a lot of you have asked me to make a complete retrospective for the Elder Scrolls series, but I just couldn't do it. This video as it stands  took me four months to play through the games, write the script, and do the recording. I did consider doing a total Elder Scrolls vs. Dragon Age video-- but as soon as I began Oblivion after spending 110 hours on Skyrim, I knew it wasn't going to happen. I hope you enjoy this video anyway,"

In a previous video, I said that I thought Rain World's movement system, and all the advanced movement it has to offer, weren't important enough to put the game up into the big leagues with games like Celeste, Team Fortress 2, or Ultrakill in having perfect movement systems.

And with Rain World: Downpour just around the corner, I worry that this lack of usefulness of the movement tech will only get worse. So let me explain myself..."

Since we're on the topic of AI, apparently...

I wanna talk about the best AI I've ever seen in a game. Because at the end of my last video I showed a clip that really didn't do it justice. This is from Rain World, which actually has some of the most incredible AI in any game I've ever played.

And I kinda threw it under the bus.

So to make sure it gets the credit it deserves, I want to talk about how Rain World has some of the best AI in the business.

Basically I'm just going to sit and praise rain world again....

Rain World is a game about desperately trying to survive in a broken ecosystem, but at least you get to be an adorable slugcat while doing it! Can we find our way back to our nomadic family before we are consumed by giant terrifying monsters or swept away by torrential downpours? No, probably not. But we'll try anyway, because what else are we going to do?

Thanks to Netflix, Castlevania is currently more popular than it's ever been but where are the new games? Why is it that a series that has given us countless classic games and spawned entire genres lies dormant?

There is only one way to find out and that's to embark on a journey through all 33 games, across Belmonts and Vampires, consoles and generations - deep into the house of the dark Count Dracula.

It's part critique, part retrospective, part review and part history lesson - obviously full of spoilers and obviously full of my opinions.

"-uJjmXcVZLo","My Strange Obsession With Gaming Elevators","Daryl Talks Games","2023-02-03","2023-01-28","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-uJjmXcVZLo/hqdefault.jpg","Elevators are unsung heroes in games. They are strange little places that we all find ourselves for a brief moment in passing. In some cases they just hide a loading screen or move us from floor to floor, but today, I want to send a big weird love letter to the elevators in games that go above and beyond. And hopefully, by doing so, I can convince you that I am not insane for being oddly obsessed with them…
