That Rohan section is completely inaccurate, Rohan is actually YOUNGER in the side more comic than he is in the main story of part 4, meaning that the point I was trying to make there is invalid.
There’s actually a really good wave motion article about it that gets it right:

Apologies for the misinformation.

 The music in Akira is not “Traditional Japanese music” it is a mix of world music but primarily Gamelan from Indonesia, Indonesia having had some… colonization issues with Japan, so that’s a pretty bad mistake to make. I Apologize for the mistake, and to anyone who was offended.


Hey. Akira’s a pretty good movie. Kind of changed the history of anime. Gonna talk about it now.
