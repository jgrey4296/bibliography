They've sailed SV Delos – a 53' sloop rig ketch – 83,000 nautical miles which is the equivalent of circling the earth at the equator more than 3 times.  Their latest adventures include sailing as a family with their 6-month baby, Sierra, and outfitting the boat with a heater so they can explore the Arctic this summer after several years in the Tropics.

Game description via Wikipedia:

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, making it the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise

BioWare is planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, into the creation of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game will feature larger environments with much more opportunity for exploration.

BioWare has confirmed that multiple playable races are returning, both male and female. Players can play as a human, dwarf, or elf just like in Dragon Age: Origins. Additionally, Qunari are also playable for the first time.

However, combat is expected to differ somewhat from its direct predecessor and focus more on a player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with his or her party members, requiring fewer repetitive finger strikes but better thinking like the first installment. Tactical view also returns for all five platforms in Dragon Age: Inquisition[citation needed], whereas before it was exclusive to PC in Dragon Age: Origins, and which was removed in Dragon Age II.

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to BioWare's previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs will occur in reaction to events and variables specific to each character and include ""mature and tasteful"" sex scenes. Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex.

Developers vowed to their fans that, compared to its predecessors, the decisions they made throughout the series will have a greater impact on the story and that the player will be given more control over their gaming experience.

Customization is said to be expanded in the next game. The developers addressed mainly how equipment would be handled with party members. They described a situation in which the player found a breastplate and decided to give it to a party member; depending upon which party member received it, the breastplate would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining his or her identity. It was also hinted that armor customization will go as far as altering its color and pattern. Players will also be able to customize their keeps which will be able to be customized for espionage, commerce or military might depending on the type of keep the player has chosen. The player will also be given a series of options to affect the area around the keep, such as building statues or capping vents. The player, though, will apparently not have enough resources for all the options available, as the Inquisition's resources are limited.

Players will be able to gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort. Once the Inquisition has a base in the area, new areas, if applicable, will open up and become available to the player. These areas may have been blocked before, such as by a hazardous gas. By opening up such areas players will not only be able to explore the whole of an area but will also be able to visit previously unreachable locations and side quests.

Inquisition will also feature two forms of combat system. The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most action-RPG's, including Dragon Age II. This system is action oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of an old RPG, including Dragon Age: Origins. This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the characters in their group and then resume the game to see it played out. During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and also allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused."

From the new album 'Emergence' out now
Buy 'Emergence' http://MaxCooper.lnk.to/Emergence
Album explained: https://emergence.maxcooper.net/

I'm really excited about this video project, after the first live show it was the part that everyone was asking about - It is a beautiful humanised exploration of life and emergence, by Maxime Causeret. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

The idea for this part of the story started on a day when there was really heavy rain hitting the roof window at my old flat. I got out my binaural mics and put my head right up by the window with the big raindrops hitting all around. They made nice individual percussive noises, with great spatial positioning, so I decided to use them to seed a piece of music.

This track is the most explicit representation of the idea of emergence in the album, because the rhythm of the track is created by the raindrops in an emergent manner - I took the audio samples, mapped the transients for the raindrop hits, and then forced the mapped points towards the nearest drumming grid positions. This meant that the random raindrops were pushed into a quantised grid, and the result was that a percussive rhythm emerged, one that I hadn't created myself, but was the closest rhythm to that particular section of rain.

I then played the sansula over this rain rhythm, and added lots of pads and saturation layers, finally with some vocal snippets from Kathrin deBoer to complete the track. Maxime Causeret selected this track to work with, under the brief to map the emergent rhythm to an exploration of emergence in living form.

His video shows the raindrops initially, then going into simple cellular forms and then showing the important idea of cooperation between simple cells to form more robust colonies of life. This develops into a visualisation of the idea of endosymbiosis, where simpler smaller organisms can live inside larger cells, each providing a benefit to the other, and eventually forming parts of the same organism as they evolve to be entirely dependent on each other. The video also shows competition between organisms for resources, which spurs on their evolutionary development, as each species tries to keep up with the innovations of the others. He also visualises the emergent ideas of flocking behaviour, where groups of individuals form beautiful dancing-like patterns.

Maxime also shows us a section of animated reaction-diffusion patterns, where simple chemical feedback mechanisms can yield complex flowing bands of colour - these forms of system were originally thought up by Alan Turing, and were part of the early seeds of the field of systems biology, which seeks to simulate life with computers, in order to better understand the systems producing the complexity we see in the living world. They were also the starting point of my main research area many years ago before I got lost in music! (where I began with the question of what patterns could be produced via reaction-diffusion forms of system as opposed to gene-regulatory network controlled patterning).

So it's a rich visual treat from Maxime on many levels, I can see why so many people were asking about it after the first live show. Lots more amazing video content to come over the next few weeks.

Some words from Maxime about his process (translated from French):

I firstly made a lot of small experiments with dynamic systems around my main idea of living micro organism. It was hard to then put everything together. It was now time to experiment with editing. I also ask for opinions, ideas and tests of few friends, specially Leslie Murard. Then i just have to do the real shots from my experiments.

In terms of tools, I work with Houdini. It's a software which gives you a lot of freedom. You can easily customize tools or build your own tools. It's famous for vfx but you have the same freedom with modelling or animation tools for cheap when you're a freelance.
I always start with few sketches on paper for ideas. I also search for références drawings/photos/painting. In Houdini i try to setup something fast to Cook or at least fast to preview in order to animate the shots in good conditions.

The major challenge was to put everything together. There's nothing very hard but it's never easy to get something who ""works"" so it needed time to adjust things. This production was made this summer on 4 months but not at full time. I also had few other projects.

Terry Pratchett was a busy bibliophile. He did write Good Omens with Neil Gaiman and pen more than thirty Discworld books, but he also created more than 100 works total during his lifetime. Quite a tall stack, even for the most intrepid reader, but worth the delve if you have the time.

In this video, we help you orient yourself within his massive oeuvre by introducing you to some of his strangest—and cleverest—characters.

▬▬▬▬ What is Tale Foundry? ▬▬▬▬
If fiction were a material, we would be its manufacturing plant. We take apart stories to see what makes them tick, then recycle what we find to create our own.

Because understanding how fiction works is complicated and making use of that knowledge is even harder, we like to stretch our topics across three-part series. We create an analytical starter episode, a list full of interesting facts and ideas, and end with a short story that makes use of everything we learned.

5 years ago, I started work on my first unity project with very little experience. I’d made some smaller hobbyist games in Game Maker Studio, but this was the first time working on something professional. And progress… was really slow. Beyond art and programming, I had to worry about a whole range of skills I hadn’t really considered - like music, sound design, user experience, marketing, and game design itself.

It’s no secret that game development takes a long time. But fast forward 5 years, and I now have a relatively complete game that I’m really happy with! It’s simple, juicy and fun. However, the path from there to here was very shaky, with a lot of setbacks and tough lessons. And halfway through, I even had to scrap development and start over from scratch!

But you know, these kinds of problems seem to happen to a lot of new developers - to varying degrees. And that’s why I’ve made this video, so that you can learn something from my mistakes."

An  insane deep diving retrospective about Metal Gear Solid 2, it’s creator, inspirations, characters, themes and story.
Also a lot of my own personal experiences with the game and fan theory conjuring done since 2001. Basically everything I’ve ever wanted to say about MGS2 over the years

Metal Gear Solid 2 is a memetic, prophetic absurd, surreal masterpiece that’s holds a special place in my heart, and we’re going to look at every angle of this Bizarre Adventure.

The Nemesis System in Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a unique villain generator. But in the sequel, Shadow of War, it's a full on story generator. Here's how it makes narratives that are interesting, meaningful, and memorable.

You can hear the theme of parallel 3rds weave its way into this song. In this deep dive video, I'm mostly looking at the tonal center or perhaps lack thereof, but there are a few other elements that make this song less 'at peace' and more 'adrift' than I had realized previously. This is also a great video for you if you're curious about modes, such as Lydian and Dorian, and microtones! And...bugs?

Bad code, poor performance, no concrete gameplay loop and more. In this Yandere Simulator code review, we'll analyse Yandere Simulator’s code and discuss how to fix the game. From code optimization, to poor graphics performance and low frame rate, to a breakdown of IF Statements and 17,000 lines of code in the StudentScript. We review many ways of fixing or improving Yandere Simulator’s programming within the Unity Game Engine.

Game Development and coding can be hard - this video is not intended to insult YandereDev (despite the negativity he seems to like to create), those just starting off, or bad programming in general, rather for us to learn from poorly performing code and explore better game development practices and general game development tips.

YandereDev is not known for welcoming advice of any kind and often sees it as an insult, but thats how it should be taken. This popular indie game is a perfect example to learn from bad programming practices as we talk about what not to do and how not to act as a Game Developer. The game Watashi No Mono and Lovesick are great examples of good game development practices.

I don't claim to be a Game Dev expert or Unity expert whatsoever, but it doesn't take an expert to understand why some of these practices aren't exactly favoured and contribute to the poor performance of the game.

This is a multipart video series just stitched together, and I apologize for the audio quality of the first couple of videos: I got a better setup for the later parts. Unfortunately there's some hitching during scenes caused by dropped frames during recording thanks to Gamebryo being 13 years old and Davinci Resolve having no idea what to do with those missing frames after rendering the videos twice. If the hitching is too obnoxious, the original videos are much smoother and can be found in the playlist here: https://rb.gy/wxoehn

This is the largest trade hub in EVE online, A massively multiplayer spaceship game with by far the most realistic financial system in the virtual world. And this is downtown Manhattan, the largest trade hub, in well, the real world.

These two regions of concentrated commerce have more than you might expect in common and what has happened before in this virtual world, might be a very good indication of what end’s up happening here in the real world.

But we are getting ahead of ourselves.

In our last video in this series we explored how eve online’s massive in game wars were financed, and at a cost of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars… why they were financed…

Now a few people reached out to me after that video and said I missed a very interesting detail, the battle over in game tax havens.

You see when a financial system is as realistic as the one in EVE Online, it comes with some unfortunate realities as well, most notably, needing to work hard to make in game money, currency inflation and of course paying taxes…


So it’s time to learn how money works and take a look at the different taxes players in eve online are expected to pay, how they avoid paying them, and what this can teach us about the fate of New York.

The GMTK Game Jam gives you 48 hours to develop a game from scratch. The theme was ""out of control"". The idea I settled on was a puzzle game involving cellular automata, inspired by Conway's Game of Life. Players will set some initial conditions of various cells on a grid, and then the simulation will play out.

I pulled out the good ol' Unity game engine to build this game. After some serious struggle, I eventually developed a possible game idea and figured out how to program it (didn't actually end up using cellular automata, but it kind of mimics it).

There are different types of cells with specific functions. A mover cell moves in one direction and pushes any cells in its way. A rotate cell will spin cells that touch it. A generator cell with duplicate another cell.
game development. The idea is that combining these will lead to emergent gameplay (with the goal being to destroy enemy cells).

During this game development marathon, I added animations, made some levels, attempted pixel art, made some more levels, programmed dragging and controls, and added even more levels. I finished the game about 4 hours before the deadline, which gave me plenty of time to make builds and submit. After that I actually fixed a bug and added level saving, and updated everything an hour before the deadline.

So I think I started to scratch the surface of emergent gameplay, something I've always wanted to do. The game is called Cell Machine, it's available on web/PC for now, but I might port it to mobile, but only if I can come up with a good title for that video lol.

I will be re-recording this into batches I think at some point to make it easier to do and upload. This will give me the time to properly talk about each class as much as I would like, since even though this video is only 5 hours long it was actually brutal on my throat. Eventually I would like to see 5 or 6 videos of 10 hours of footage uploaded. We'll see how long it takes. Thanks for watching friends.

All cleric mage and thief kits are about the same for dual classing so if you're an assassin or bounty hunter and are dual classing into a fighter, I don't think it merits a tier difference.

In this speedrun explained, we break down an Any% speedrun of the original BioShock (sorry, not the remastered version). This run is performed by KPCzombie, one of the top runners for the game. This run includes ways to skip doors, cutscenes, and even entire levels. Sorry, but there’s no ADAM duplication glitch used in this run! This video serves as an explanation of the strategies used by KPC to beat BioShock in under 29 minutes.

#BioShock #Speedrun

The first fling in the run, which saves ten seconds, is specifically called “YOLO fling” since it was a known about fling, but it wasn’t done in runs due to its difficulty. KPC was on a run that was pretty much dead and decided to say YOLO and try the fling since he knew about it, and ended up getting it first try. This led to him pulling the run back to be a world record, making the fling just become part of the route. Gotta love glitches and moments like that in speedruns/speedrunning."

Let's make a language so bad it would make people run screaming to Visual Basic for Applications.

"_mZBa3sqTrI","Plain Text - Dylan Beattie - NDC Oslo 2021","NDC Conferences","2023-10-14","2022-02-15","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_mZBa3sqTrI/hqdefault.jpg","Software is complicated. Machine learning, microservice architectures, message queues... every few months there's another revolutionary idea to consider, another framework to learn. And underneath so many of these amazing ideas and abstractions is text. When you work in software, you spend your life working with text. Some of those text files are source code, some are configuration files, some of them are documentation. Editors, revision control systems, programming languages - everything from C# and HTML to Git and VS Code is based on the idea of ""plain text files"". But... what if I told you there's no such thing?

When we say something is a ""plain text file"", we're relying on a huge number of assumptions - about operating systems, editors, file formats, language, culture, history... and, most of the time, that's OK. But when it goes wrong, ""plain text"" can lead to some of the weirdest bugs you've ever seen... why is there Chinese in the event logs? Why is the city of Aarhus in the wrong place? And why does Magnus Mårtensson always have trouble getting into the USA? Join Dylan Beattie for a fascinating look into the hidden world of text files - from the history of mechanical teletypes to encodings, collations and code pages. We'll look at some memorable bugs, some golden rules for working with plain text - and we'll even find out the story behind the mysterious phrase ""pike matchbox"" and what it has do with driving in Belarus.

Drawing some inspiration from vexing current events, we find that creative, structured thought on adjacent (but frivolous) problems is a sort of digestive act, and one that is ultimately laxative.

Paper, source code, ringtones (and for a limited time, the data and viewer from pinging the whole internet): http://tom7.org/harder

Errata (thanks to all pedantic viewers who catch this stuff):
 - I got the escape velocity off by a factor of 1000! It's 11 km/sec, not 11,000 km/sec. I think the other calculations are correct; I just mistook a period for a comma in my bleary-eyed late-night editing.
 - I got the size of the genome wrong due to a very silly bug from bleary-eyed late-night programming. It is 29903 base pairs, which can be stored in an economy-sized 7476 bytes.

A lot’s been said over the years regarding the varying, uh, quality of the work within the Final Fantasy X mythos.

Well, if you like the world of Spira, at least.

Dorohedoro is the story of a lizard man named Kaiman and his friend Nikaido, as they try and find out what happened to his face. In a world filled with magic and sorcerers, it seems like a fairly simple plot. But oh boy would you be mistaken. Dorohedoro is a walk on the wild side, a dip into pure insanity and excellency that can only be gifted through the pure art of Q Hayashida's work. Last year we talked about Dorohedoro the anime, this year we're discussing Dorohedoro the manga. It's just a simple story that takes over 40 minutes to tell. No big deal.

This is a breakdown of the lore and importance of every single starting persona in every single persona game. Shin Megami Tensei smt, and specifically persona lore has interested me for a very long time. This interest was so great that it was the first series ever to be on Tony4you! Despite the massive differences in audio quality throughout the years, I believe the lore behind each party member deserves to be heard and have a small spotlight on them for the significance of the choice. Persona lore and smt lore as it relates to real life historical and mythological figures has been my bread and butter for a long time and every now and then it's nice to look back at what I've already discussed to get the entire scope of this amazing series. The entire persona lore condensed into one series, meaning behind the persona, and those videos condensed in to one massive compilation. Meaning behind the persona: the complete series was something I've been meaning to compile together for a long time, and here it finally is, I hope you enjoy. Also seeing me grow as a content creator in reverse order since I made these videos in reverse chronological order (except the personas of persona 5 strikers). Also at the time I did not have a console and was really slumming it. Times sure have changed, but meaning behind the persona was always my baby of a series."

In the first part of this duo, we’ll be looking at 2 shows that, in my opinion, perfectly balance tension with constant feeling of power progression, those being Avatar The Last Airbender and Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, specifically part 3 – Stardust Crusaders and Battle in Egypt.  In these shows, it always feel like there are very serious odds, yet we still have the payoff is seeing our characters overcome the challenge, so we try to understand why some shows somehow lose this feeling along the way.

I’ll also discuss uniquely Japanese concepts like “gaman” and “shikata ga nai,” and how they play a role in preventing people from challenging abusive authority. As someone of Japanese American heritage, fostering better cultural understanding and context when it comes to Persona games just means a lot to me.

---

If I were to tell you ‘Rain World has the most complex ecosystem of any game,’ you might go… ‘What?’ Because Rain World doesn’t seem particularly advanced — it’s a 2D pixel art game where you play as a weird slug, how complicated could its world really be?

While there are other games with fancier graphics and denser lore, Rain World’s unique system of procedurally generated animation and complex AI come together to simulate the feeling of a living ecosystem better than (almost) any other game I’ve played. From the lizards, to the scavengers, to the daddy long legs, it’s an incredible feat of worldbuilding.

So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll uncover the fascinating intricacies of Rain World’s pixeled biosphere. Now, let’s become part of this virtual food chain…

So, you could say this video has been a long time coming. Maybe even the longest time coming. A lot of people have asked when I was going to return to NieR content. My last NieR Replicant video was about a year and a bit ago, and my NieR Reincarnation video was shortly before that. Plus, this marks about the one year anniversary since I transitioned to long-form video essay content, about a year since I made the Final Fantasy XIII video, so I figured now would be a good time.

So yeah, NieR Automata is a game that's special to a lot of people. Me included. There are probably a ton of reasons why that is. Platinum Games brought their signature gameplay to the table. Yoko Taro from Square Enix brought his signature storytelling. But a game that should have been really good, but relatively niche, ended up becoming a household name that was greater than the sum of it's parts. How you ask? Well, just watch and find out.

They don't fit neatly into one genre - instead they are characterized by emergent game play stemming from procedural generation and detailed interactions. The iconic example of this is Dwarf Fortress, a game which is tough but with extreme detail in its mechanics. Despite being the grandfather of many indie games, Dwarf Fortress and games like it don't get talked about often enough.

In this video I discuss Dwarf Fortress and other story generators, such as Rimworld, Paradox grand strategy games, Barotrauma, and Space Station 13. As a specific example, I played the Paradox strategy game Stellaris and talk about the various decisions I needed to make when I unintentionally made the game more difficult than I intended.

For too long has it languished in the shadow of Resident Evil and today we'll be shining the spotlight on just what made it such a survival horror classic and why people are desperate for a Dino Crisis remake.

There will be many tangents - Where Devil May Cry came from? What movies does Shinji Mikami like? Why does nobody play Time Crisis with a controller and just how exactly does a dinosaur fly a spaceship?

It's part critique, part retrospective, part review and part history lesson - obviously full of spoilers and obviously full of my opinions.

Why Do You Always Kill Gods in JRPGs?

If you've ever played a Japanese Role Playing Game, or JRPG, you've likely encountered this trope before -- why exactly is the final boss, or secret mastermind, always some kind of evil god? Is there a reason for this trope beyond the obvious? Why is the evil god often some kind of alien?

Let's take a very deep dive into Japanese history together, and figure out this mystery together. We will start with the roots of Japanese religion in Ancient China, move through the conflict-filled religious history of Japan, and then finally conceptualize a historical religious cycle now coming to a climax in the contemporary experiences of the Japanese people, as expressed through the medium of video games.

This is the first video I've made over an hour, and so there are a few hiccups in audio here and there! Please excuse this first experiment: I will strive to improve the quality for you, as more videos of this nature are released.

Is there something which makes life worthwhile? Or do we succumb to the absurd?

Many have asked about the meaning of life, a reason for being, purpose, or other similar concepts. Some ideas, like existentialism, embrace the random nature of the universe and say there is no meaning of life on a greater scale, but we instead make one ourselves; existence precedes essence. However, absurdism takes this a step further, rejecting found purposes all together, instead claiming a revolt against the absurd is the only option. We must not turn away from the daily toil, from our inescapable fate, or the meaninglessness which surrounds us. We must fight it.

Today, we'll be exploring this feeling through example within some of the best anime to watch. Whether it's Asuka and Shinji's depression in Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE or Eva), Revy's static Roanapur life in Black Lagoon, Spike and Faye drifting though space in Cowboy Bebop, the existentialism of Naoto in FLCL, and particularly of Nagara in Sonny Boy, or even challenging God in Vinland Saga like Canute, each one provides some insight into our question; is life worth living? What becomes of those who have no purpose, those who accomplish their reason for being, and those who have the meaning of life stollen away? Is purpose even something to strive for, or do we simply rebel against the Absurd? Taking from the Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus, we reach one possible conclusion; the only answer is constant revolt. We must become an absurd hero, like Sisyphus. Which of our characters are so? Shinji from Evangelion? Spike from Cowboy Bebop? Canute from Vinland Saga? Let's find out...

About this video:
In this video Axel Beats does a chapter walkthrough of One Piece. Odyssey, Iliad, and other famous fictional literature pieces have paved the way for other works of literature like manga, anime, video games on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. In this case, AxelBeats retrospectively reviews the manga One Piece by Eiichiro Oda, which was later adapted into a popular anime by Toei Animation. Our discussion follows the story of Monkey D. Luffy who wants to become King of the pirates. Along his quest he meets: a skilled swordsman named Zoro; Nami, a thief with a talent for navigation; Usopp, a liar who is skilled in long distance sniping, even being dubbed the Sniper King; Sanji, a the chef who kicks; Chopper, a reindeer who excels in medicine; Nico Robin, an archaeologist; Franky, a cyborg who is a talented shipright; Brook, a skeleton who can play any instrument and sing; and Ginbe, the fishman. The gang sets sail towards the Grand Line to find the treasure of One Piece. In this video, Axel explores the arcs Romance Dawn, Alabasta, Skypedia, Water 7, Enies Lobby, Thriller Bark, Impel Down, Summit War, Marineford, Fishman Island, Punk Hazard, Dressrosa, Zou, Whole Cake Island, and Wano Country/Wano Kuni. On this One Piece odyssey, no poneglyph is left unturned as we explore all of the lore, theories, and analysis of One Piece in this high definition historical retrospective and video essay.

In this SPEEDRUN EXPLAINED, we break down an Any% (No SLA) speedrun of Portal 2. This run is performed by Msushi, one of the top runners for this game. This run disallows saving and loading due to those features being able to easily break the game, and also disallows going out-of-bounds. What this run DOES include though, is tight movement (such as bunnyhopping), cutscene skips, glitches, exploits, and solving a lot of the chambers in just a few seconds. This video serves as an explanation of the strategies used by Msushi (and other speedrunners) to beat Portal 2 in under an hour.

#Portal2 #SourceEngine #Speedrun

Fullbright is more or less just increased brightness, and is something you can set up in the preference files of Portal 2. Fullbright makes it a lot easier for speedrunners to navigate dark levels, but Msushi mainly has it on for you at home since he can actually navigate the levels pretty decently in the dark. You're able to set up your preference files so that individual levels load with fullbright on, so that you don't need to go into any settings or anything when you load into dark levels.

5:08 - Your vertical velocity doesn't affect the speedlock, only your overall horizontal velocity.

12:24 - The Laser Switch Glitch (LSG) is actually what's described at 19:20, and just so happens to be often used on doors. The door thing itself is not LSG and doesn't really have a name.

12:34 - Ticks aren't the same as frames, they're a fixed interval of 1/60 of a second (0.0166s).

12:43 - This glitch isn't due to an overlap in the hitboxes, but rather a strange consequence of the fact that the door hitbox is entirely behind the portal.

13:51 - This glitch isn't related to the number of entities, but rather is a strange bug caused by a system implemented to prevent timing issues with buttons whose output is on a delay. See https://wiki.portal2.sr/Button_Glitch for details.

19:20 - LSG isn't caused by the portal decay and laser staying in place for a moment, but rather is caused by the laser receiver staying on for a short amount of time after the laser itself disappears.

1:00:30 - The funnel counter actually only goes up to 2 after he uncrouches again, since this glitch is really caused by ~changing~ whether you're crouched whilst standing still in a funnel. See https://wiki.portal2.sr/Crouch_Fly_Glitch for details."

Opal is easily one of the most beautiful gem stones and surprisingly it is also quite easy to grow synthetically. Unlike other gems which are solid crystals, opal is made of silica nanoparticles which have to be stacked together in just the right way to produce their magnificent colors. By growing silica nanoparticles of the right size, synthetic opal can be grown that looks just as amazing as the real thing.

- Footnotes

(1) Most numbers in this video are for illustrative purposes only, and do not necessarily represent the values in any The Sims game.

(2) In The Sims 3, the ""Comfort"" and ""Room"" motives are removed, leaving six basic needs. These are instead represented by ""Moodlets"", which are little boosts and nerfs to the Sim's happiness for doing things like sitting in a comfy chair or walking into a smelly room.

(3) The Sims are strictly male and female in the first three games, but The Sims 4 expands this with the ability to individually set a character's appearance, pronouns, and more.

I don't think I've played any other that captures the same vibe. If you enjoy platformers but also enjoy fleeing from wild animals and existential dread you'll like this game.

It's been a while since my last upload, and the reasoning behind that is partially my fault. I hope to not leave too big of a gap in between uploads but this is an unpaid hobby that sucks up time like nothing else. Next video's script is already mostly done, but it's going to be even longer than this one so place your bets on what month that's getting finished.

Rust Features that I Want in C++ - David Sankel - CppNow 2022
---

By many accounts, Rust is one of the fastest growing programming languages out there. While there are many factors fueling this growth, this talk will focus on the aspects of Rust that make it particularly attractive as a systems programming language. This covers tooling, community, strategy, and, of course, features.

Throughout the talk we'll be revisiting the question, ""Can we have this in C++ and, if so, how can we get it?"" While we'll examine the practicalities of the ISO process and the limitations of backwards compatibility, there is a lot of optimism to be had.

This talk assumes an intermediate level of C++ know-how and no prior knowledge of Rust.

Hellish Quart is an early access sword fighting game that is not very famous among players. It is a fighting game about sword dueling, in which the blades really clash using physics, and the characters use motion captured fencing techniques. Play as one of many 17th century warriors and use sabers, rapiers, broadswords, and many other blades in quick fights, survival mode, or LOCAL multiplayer with friends (you can play online too with Steam Remote Play Together). You can also casually spar with wooden weapons or train in modern HEMA gear."

Discover more about its two creators Tarn and Zach Adams. From a very young age, Tarn and Zach’s dad taught them the basics of coding and this led to the brothers creating about 400 games in the BASIC programming language. They were inspired by tabletop RPGs such as Dungeons & Dragons and Cyberpunk 2020, as well as many roguelike games from the eighties such as Hack, Rogue, Larn and Ragnarok. When Tarn and Zach were 12 and 14 respectively, they started developing their very first fantasy game that would eventually evolve into Dwarf Fortress.

The documentary also explores all the design decisions that Bay 12 Games made and shows why the project went from 3D graphics to using simple ASCII text-based graphics. It also takes a close look at all the hurdles the brothers had to go through. From struggling to become full-time indie developers, and Tarn’s bank account skimming zero multiple times, to completely overhauling the game’s world generation system during the process of adding a z-axis to Dwarf Fortress. Additionally, after Zach got skin cancer, the two developers started thinking more about their health insurance and how expensive it is. Therefore, they decided to partner with publisher Kitfox Games and develop a commercial version of Dwarf Fortress that was released on Steam and Itch.io in 2022. Lastly, the documentary takes a look at what’s next for the brothers, who are now millionaires, and their growing team and what we can expect of Dwarf Fortress in the future.

The 25th of August, 2009, was a dark night for the Batman. But out of Arkham Asylum’s darkness was born a Bat with love, craft, care, and colour injected into his veins and the hearts of his enemies. A pulpy, full-throttle swing into madness where – on repeat playthroughs – you can trace the lines of code Rocksteady lay to find their Batman and give his world a voice.

So let's talk about Arkham Asylum and its inspirations to see how Rocksteady found their Batman, and let us find him right alongside them.

"3GbgQBjBfPA","Before Bauhaus: How Goth Became Goth","Trash Theory","2023-10-14","2019-12-19","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3GbgQBjBfPA/hqdefault.jpg","Goth is many things. It's a Germanic tribe, a style of architecture, a type of literature, of film. It's a youth movement. What ties most of these together is a sense of dark romanticism. But despite Marilyn Manson and My Chemical Romance being infamous for their adoption of gothic fashion, their music isn't what would traditionally be classified as goth. To quote Sasha Geffen of Pitchfork: “[Goth] songs were marked by echoes, distortion, minimal guitar lines, and an arch taste for the macabre; their electroshocked hair, smears of black eyeliner, and dark clothes only reinforced the vibe.”

So while any youth dressed in black with a fondness for obvious make-up can be dubbed “goth”, it doesn't mean they listen to goth music. That is a separate thing with its own sonic template. So as the nights grow increasingly cold and dark, join me in discovering how we got to the point where goth became a defined genre with a look, sound and lyrical preferences, from the early delves into darkness of ""I Put a Spell on You"" by Screamin Jay Hawkins, ""The End"" by The Doors and ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" by Velvet Underground, through ""Dead Babies"" by Alice Cooper, ""In Every Dreamhome, a Heartache"" by Roxy Music, ""Third Uncle"" by Brian Eno, ""Human Fly"" by the Cramps, Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division, ending with ""A Forest"" by The Cure and ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" by Bauhaus This is ""How Goth Became Goth"".

LESSON NOTES
============
Amitai Etzioni addressed the question of how organizations elicit compliance from their members, concluding that there are three types of organization, each wielding a different sort of power:

1. Coercive Power:  Organizations that can enforce compliance by the use of sanctions, restraint, or even physical force. They may also exert control over things we need. Coercive organizations leave members alienated from them.
Examples include custodial institutions, cults, and crime gangs.

2. Remunerative Power:  Organizations that achieve compliance by the giving and withholding of rewards. This is the most common form of power in business, where the rewards are economic benefits and sometimes enhanced status.  This form of power is transactional and depends on the people from whom the organization wants compliance seeing the rewards as a fair trade for their obedience.
Also called calculative or utilitarian organizations; members are committed to the rewards, asking ‘what’s in it for me?’.
Businesses tend to be utilitarian organizations.

3. Normative Power:  Organizations that win compliance through conviction to shared beliefs or values.  Normative organizations create commitment from members who believe the organization has the right to expect compliance.
Normative power is wielded by organizations over people who share their aims and intentions. Voluntary organizations and religions are examples, but many businesses try to create this by appealing to common values.

But remember, it is the substance and detail of how an organization behaves that determine which form of power it applies, rather than the form of the organization:
• While most religions would (and should) see themselves as normative, there are plenty who offer redemption as a reward for good behavior (utilitarian). And there are some that threaten severe sanctions (coercive).
• Most employers are clearly in the utilitarian category, but some offer an inspiring workplace that people enjoy and value (normative). Others create its mirror: a poisonous workplace of bullying and fear (coercive).
• Whilst the classic model of prison is certainly coercive, the best of modern penal systems can offer the rewards of rehabilitation (utilitarian) or even a régime that prisoners respect and value (normative).

This model does not tell us how individuals within the organizations secure compliance.

There have been quite a few overpowered weapons in the history of the game, which is expected for a game this diverse. But the nerfs that accompany it also have a huge range of acceptability, and that's what I'm interested in today. There are about 30 weapons that could go here, but I've picked out a good few that I believe are the most nerfed in the history of TF2. For anyone wondering how I got background video of weapons in a state before their nerf, all of the gameplay was recorded on servers running a revert mod. It was super interesting to actually play around with some of the pre-nerf versions of weapons, and I have to say, I wish a lot of them would come back. Let me know what you think!

Pre-nerf servers in the video are Nailgun World and Crow's Nest. Go check them out!

Villains are always making deals and contracts, which half the time don’t even make sense. Even when they have the power to get what they want, for some reason they just can’t resist trying to get the hero to put their X on the line…

But it seems like there’s actually a pretty good reason why.

Originally published in 1981, Codex Seraphinianus is not an easy book to track down. Written by surreal artist Luigi Serafini, the book is designed to be completely alien to anyone who picks it up.

The world of impossibilities within at first don’t seem to follow any logic. Not only are the images utterly mind-bending, but it’s written in a made-up, and thoroughly untranslatable language. And yet, the more you read, the more you find a strange sense of continuity among the images.

So, for this entry into the archive, I’m going to do my best to document the alternate dimension Luigi Serafini created, bearing in mind the codex is, by design, meant to be untranslatable.

Sometimes the AI in a videogame has lots of perfectly valid actions it can take, but deciding which one can be quite difficult.  Utility AI is one approach to help solve it, by calculating how useful that action is based on the current context.  We look at how it works, some simple calculations and how games ranging from @eavideos's 'The Sims', all the way to @CreativeAssembly's 'Total War' series, adopt Utility AI in their games.

We derive the Macroscopic Perspective (Continuum) from the Microscopic Perspective (Molecules) covering: Collective Molecular Behavior, Local (Non-)Equilibria, Classical Statistical Mechanics, Rarefied Gas Dynamics, and Continuum Gas Dynamics.

The Macroscopic Perspective provides the ground for the next part where we make it all numerically accessible - the Discretization.

Disclaimer:
------------------
This series focuses specifically on the aspect of information reduction in dynamical systems. For the sake of clarity, I had to omit many interesting aspects of the topics addressed in the video. So, the video itself is a reduction. :-)


Please note:
------------------
Watching this video with very low resolution produces the continua right away :-), thanks to the video compression!

This was taken from my livestream on January 1st, 2021! I'm live every day but Saturday, come watch: http://twitch.tv/Northernlion

The Trolley Problem is a classic philosophical thought experiment where there are entities on two train tracks, one of which is about to be hit by a trolley. Given the option, would you act and pull the lever to divert the trolley, causing it to miss the original victim at the expense of whatever's on track two? Naturally this is a great fit for a video game, and despite its thin premise it was a lot of fun. Check it out!"

"2a5gwWnTKpI","Isaac Asimov's Foundation Explained In FIVE Minutes! (Some Spoilers)","Quinn's Ideas","2023-10-14","2021-07-28","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2a5gwWnTKpI/hqdefault.jpg","Isaac Asimov’s Foundation Series was the first-ever science fiction series to contain a full-fledged galactic empire. The entire series involves the centuries-long plan of a man known as Hari Seldon, to restore the human galactic empire after a great crash that led to a dark age. Hari Seldon was able to predict the fall of the first galactic empire by use of a form of mathematics known as psychohistory, which was able to predict human behavior overtime at mass.

Essentially the empire fell due to the capital planet, Trantor's inability to adequately handle the bureaucratic and administrative demands of such a large empire, containing 25 Million worlds. Hari Seldon’s Solution would ultimately prove to be extremely complicated and multifaceted, but it is presented initially as the creation of the Foundation. The Foundation would be founded on the distant world of Terminus and would have an encyclopedist whose job was to record all human knowledge in the universe inside the Encyclopedia Galactica. Thousands of humans would devote themselves to the project in an effort to preserve the knowledge of all mankind in the hope that doing so they could shorten the interregnum which would follow the collapse of the empire.

Other video I mentioned in Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn-inp0-Xmw

TOMFOOLERY RELATED TO SLOTH

All right, so, on the Wikipedia page for the seven deadly sins, there's the following claim: ""Acēdia is negative form of the Greek term κηδεία ('Kēdeia'), which has a more restricted usage. 'Kēdeia' refers specifically to spousal love and respect for the dead. The positive term 'kēdeia' thus indicates love for one's family, even through death."" When I read this, I thought it was really cool - after all, if this is true, then Sloth would also be related to Ed and Al trying to bring their mom back to life, as that could be seen as a lack of respect for the dead. But, alas, I followed the sources cited on Wikipedia and I couldn't find something talking about this. I then followed up with one of my Patrons, Conrad, who I thought might be able to help me with this, and he reached out to a PhD friend of his who he thought might know something about these terms. Unfortunately, the PhD wasn't certain, and I'd already spent too much time trying to confirm this, so I had to stop looking. Even so, it was cool enough that I wanted to at least mention it in the video, but I also didn't want to give the sense that this is definitely true. As such, I decided to leave it in as a little throw-away, kinda joke section, and to put text leading you here, to this very paragraph your eyes glide over now. Anyway, thank you to the one person who cared to read this. Bless ya."

Everyone knows Silent Hill 2 is good but, how did it all start?

Join me as we go back to the very first Silent Hill and help Harry Mason find his daughter.

We journey through the thick fog, the scary school and the creepy hospital and fight off rabid dogs, zombie kids and posessed nurses as we uncover the truth about Dhalia, Alessa and the birthing of a dark god.

Silent Hill 1 is a horror survival game for the PlayStation 1 released in 1999.

#####

Amnesia is a seriously scary game.
But, why? what about the game design makes it so scary?

How did it become so well known, what did it do so right, and how did it manage to both redefine the exploration horror genre, and become a staple of the 'lets play' videos on Youtube?

Thanks as always to the supporters on Patreon and Twitch who keep the channel alive, if I was being followed by a shadow, I would not sacrifice you to it."

Hello explorers! I am so humbled to share with you a video I've been putting together for a long time. And, by putting together, I mean thinking about it for a month and then spending like 20 hours in a week working on it.

I've wanted to make a video essay for a very long time. There's plenty of clunky places, but I hope you can look past them. The underlying story of the RoR series is heartbreakingly tragic, and more people deserve to know about Hopoo's writing skills.

I want to thank Meg'n and Daniel, who helped me put together the chronology and provided screenshots of logs I don't have. And of course, for my loving darling, who supports everything I do. I couldn't have made this without your encouraging smiles.

I've never directly asked this of you explorers, but if you enjoyed this tale, please share it. It's difficult to put yourself out on the internet, for all to scrutinize and judge. This time, I'm incredibly proud of the final result, and I hope you like it too."

Terra Nil is a weird videogame, it claims to be a citybuilder with a reversed environmental theme, and yet, when it comes to delivering the fun you'd expect out of a citybuilder... Terra Nil just can't deliver - what gives? Is Terra Nil just a bad game coasting on false advertising, or is there something more going on here?

 After clawing their way out from the ruins of their fallen civilization, and pouring over so many ancient tomes that they started to lose their charm, The Architect has gotten a few ideas about what's really happening with Terra Nil - it's a game that is specifically designed not to reverse the citybuilder, but to invert it, and that's a pretty big difference.

Does not include #TheNewWar nor #AngelsoftheZariman. warframe duviri paradox warframe #videoessay

A Conversation, Video Essay on all the personal, cultural, and philosophy influences that inspired my love for Warframe's story. Including Plato's Republic, #Confucianism, Daoism, my experience with Autism, and much more.

Having listened to many people express that they do not have the time to devote to this video, here is a full text of the narration on my blog:
https://socratetris.wordpress.com/2022/01/08/dualism-the-meaning-of-family-warframe-philosophy-of-games/

Chapters:
00:00 Warframe - A Complex Story To Tell
01:48 Orokin & Plato's Republic
46:02 Tenno & Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan
02:31:54 WarFrame & Confucianism
04:30:26 WarFrame & Daoism
05:57:01 Warframe & Autism
06:37:47 Warframe & Cartesian Dualism
07:31:46 Buildup to The New War
08:38:21 Outro Sequence

Many in the comments have pointed out that my interpretation of TMITW can't be true, because of Entrati encountering it long before the Zarimen 10-0 accident. I'm not going to argue with this, it is probably true. However, this isn't clear in the Chains of Harrow quest. As I said at the start, I am being honest with my experience of the story and what it meant to me. The new facts came out years later and were not a part of that experience. Thanks for understanding!

Thank you for watching, my friends! If you found something interesting in this video, be sure to let me know in the comments! All are welcome! NOTES: All of the footage was recorded on a PS4 Pro, but an issue with its DVR function causes a few second to drop out very rarely. Usually this only happens during gameplay, but also happens during spoken storylines. There is really no good way to avoid this, so thank you for understanding.

Message to artists

I tried very hard to credit ever artist featured, but do to some deleted blogs/ how viral some of these images are, it was occasionally not possible to find a proper source, and theres a chance some of these images could be credited to a blog that featured them as opposed to the artists account themselves. If you see your art in this video uncredited, you can either email my business email (found on my twitter) or reply to the announcement tweet of this video, and we will get you properly credited.

As one of the Taos Six, a band of intrepid artists who traveled to, fell in love with and painted the American Southwest, Oscar E. Berninghaus captured scenes of Native People's lives with sensitivity and grace.  In preserving and conserving his painting it too will finally receive that same sensitivity and grace on the way to it's former glory.

Most likely, you’re going to block the actors, set up the camera, and do shot/reverse shot. But where do you put the camera? What lens do you use? And how do you cut back and forth? Today, I consider the Coen brothers — Joel & Ethan — and see how these choices lend a particular feel to their version of shot/reverse shot.
