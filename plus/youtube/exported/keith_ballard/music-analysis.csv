VIDEO INFO: Trent Reznor is yet another renessanse man of rock music. He‚Äôs most famous for running Nine Inch Nails, but over the years he has branched out to doing film scores, starting his own
label and doing various side-projects. But the man who created one of the darkest and most outstanding industrial albums of all time is far from finished. His new album Bad Witch is just around the corner, and just like with his previous albums,it seems like Trent is leading his
fans into yet another cryptic and dark soundscape.

Although most music is written in 4/4 time, there are various songs that instead use the odd time signature of 5/4. 5/4 has a distinctive off-kilter feel that can give a song a curious, fast-slow rhythm.

The ball positions were not generated automatically, I found where to put them through trial and error. In the future I am looking into possible ways to automate this process.

This was particularly tricky to do because the simulation is non-deterministic, so sometimes when I would try to record the screen or put my CPU under load, the physics would behave differently.

Hopefully this helps people who want to see the difference between different drum styles in a more visual way. Thanks for watching!

But they're really hard, right? Language is so complicated and weird that many of the structural approaches we theorists like to take for chords and stuff just don't work. Well, fortunately for us, we're not the only ones asking these sorts of questions, and the answers are out there. We just have to look a little further afield.

CORRECTIONS: The guitarist I referenced at the end is named ADRIAN Belew, not Andrew. Forgive me Adrian! You're a legend and I'm a fallible pig I MEAN human! Additionally, I had a moment of memory loss and inaccurately annotated the natural 3rd and natural 6th degrees of the scale with # symbols. My bad, that's wrong.
-------------
I wanted to honor the 27-year anniversary of ""The Downward Spiral"", one of my favorite albums of all time, by starting on a journey of deeply analyzing each track in the way I know how, starting with #1, ""Mr. Self Destruct"". My background is in composition, but I'm trying to push myself to think outside the spiral and consider the greater context of the music I analyze. Hope this brings you a new appreciation for this song and album.
If you're curious about all the ""notes"" I mentioned in the video because it mainly sounds like distorted noise bs to you, I made an acoustic piano cover (with creative liberties taken): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92T6y2auxAQ

Thanks for watching my analysis of ""Wish"" by Nine Inch Nails! Also Martin Atkins if you're watching, please forgive me for all the ignorant things I said. You're a legend! Anyway this video is basically about NOISE and the F word. And tritones, of course. We're breaking down ""Wish"" track by track and my wish for you is that you enjoy it, have a good scream, and then go listen to ""Live: All That Could Have Been,"" Piggies!
TRIVIA: Just learned this song WON a Grammy!
Who else wants to study Trent's noise now? What do you think of noise and soundscapes in music?

An intense, driving, instrumental experience in 5 with one of THE most satisfying endings...you don't need to be a music theory nerd to appreciate this genius. CORRECTIONS: I referenced Trent as the piano player, when it is in fact Mike Garson at least during the chaotic solo.  I also annotated the major 7th chords as ""x7"" instead of ""xMaj7"". ""x7"" refers to a dominant 7th chord, which sounds quite different. Didn't expect this much attention because I made this purely for fun but I am very appreciative that other people enjoy this way of looking at music!

Trent takes us on another interesting harmonic journey with this song to the point where I don't even make a decision about what key it's in! This video features a couple of clips from a few years back of me playing this song, which was what inspired me to analyze it for today's video! Next week I'll be analyzing possibly my favorite track from Year Zero. I write down all your requests and I'll be working on them in the coming months!
CORRECTION: At the end I sing a minor 3rd but accidentally annotated it as ""M3"" which is how major 3rds are spelled. Dang it's super hard to get through a video without some mistakes y'all! :)"

Several of you requested I analyze this song and while I liked it, I wasn't too familiar. Let's just say now I'm very familiar, and I like it a lot. Made me cry, so. Thanks for the suggestion y'all! What do you think of the piano cover at the end? Did you notice the notes I changed? I wish I had a decade more keyboard skill to do what I really wanted to do, but it was a fun project and my way of honoring this beautiful song."

I wasn't planning on analyzing another Year Zero track so soon but Zero Sum was the right track for this week. It's important that during times of unrest that we acknowledge how divided we are, but at the same time give even more attention and energy to the unity that we share. I definitely have been feeling that with all of you over the past few months! So thanks again for tuning in and being a bright light, and thanks to Nine Inch Nails for being a thread for us all to hold onto no matter who or where or when we are.
I have another related video that I'll be publishing this week.
Lyrics in the comments.

"w5D4Fky1-rI","""ADRIFT & AT PEACE"" - Nine Inch Nails // harmonic analysis","ixi music","2023-10-14","2021-03-01","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w5D4Fky1-rI/hqdefault.jpg","Did you know that Trent once said that ""Adrift & At Peace"" is the conclusion to ""La Mer""? You can hear the theme of parallel 3rds weave its way into this song. In this deep dive video, I'm mostly looking at the tonal center or perhaps lack thereof, but there are a few other elements that make this song less 'at peace' and more 'adrift' than I had realized previously. This is also a great video for you if you're curious about modes, such as Lydian and Dorian, and microtones! And...bugs?

I'm using some music theory terminology but it's intended to be understood and enjoyed by all because it's really about the emotional impact of his compositional choices. Thanks for watching! ~ixi
