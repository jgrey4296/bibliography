Have you rewatched an older bit of sci-fi and questioned why the characters haven't been using the comms tech they DO have to stay in touch? Are you a writer who's noticed YOU'VE been giving your characters cell-phone equivalents without even thinking about it? Well, I hope you're prepared for a half-hour-long descent into madness as I unpack the history of telecommunication, both fictional *and* real, and try to convince you that I haven't spent the last two months losing my mind!

It's no doubt The Sims is an influential video game. In this video essay, we're going to talk about its GAY influence, particularly the role it plays in queer people's identity development. Enjoy the presentation as we go over how the Sims influenced a generation in letting them live out their Tumblr dreams...

Bloodborne is a very...wet game. It's bloody and messy and goopy and I love it a lot, but I don't often see people talking about the more feminine aspects of its horror (pregnancy, childbirth etc) that it's absolutely bursting with (no pun intended). Content warnings are there for a reason. Some people are probably really not gonna like this and that's cool, go watch a video more to your taste, but I had fun and I hope you do as well ^.^

Terfs and gender critical folks are not welcome here. A person’s existence is not debatable.

When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released in 2005, J.K. Rowling finally described the Slytherin student character Blaise Zabini. A character many had head-cannoned as a white dark-haired Italian boy was now a Black teenager of exceptional beauty. For some, it wasn't even fully acknowledged until the film adaptation, but there was still a backlash from some fans who no longer thought the character ""fit.""

We will discuss the reaction to that revelation and why it complicated how Rowling wrote about Slytherin and Blood Purity. Even if she didn't realize it.

RECIPE

1. Forage for wild garlic and nettles. Use gardening gloves to keep from getting stung, and a good guidebook to keep from getting poisoned.
2. Using gloves, wash the nettles under boiling water, and run more hot water over them for good measure.
3. Roughly chop nettles and slice tofu, add them along with garlic, 3 teaspoons of miso paste, a veg stock cube, and optional dried wakame seaweed, to a pot of water.
4. Let simmer until nettles are soft and flavors are combined.

Today I decided to debunk Youtube's various body language 'expert' channels, who say they're providing their expert analysis on non-verbal communication, but it's all based on opinion, conjecture and pseudoscience. I explain how, and why, and how this is all based on debunked science that could even affect us all in the court system and at border control, and in the future, even with the use of AI deception detection for job screenings and even in classrooms.

HBO's Barry has a funny premise: a hitman is bored from killing people and just wants to settle down. It's a riff on the Difficult Men era of TV, defined by central middle-aged men behaving badly in shows like The Sopranos, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad. But is this premise just for laughs or is the show trying to say something deeper about masculinity?

In this video I mention Gourmet Makes a bunch and I actually felt really insecure about that just because for a long time during the edit it was feeling like I only had one example. But the reason it was on my mind so much is that the recent video with the gourmet Tater Tots was just so perfect with the intro where a parade of chefs, cooks, and foodies, the kind of folks who regularly cook hundred-dollar cuts of meat with obscure Italian names, stop by to talk about just how much they love frozen potato nuggets.

Eighteen months in the making, and 1,400+ hours of research, writing, recording, AI-upscaling, animating, sourcing and editing later, the anticipated Part 3 of my cyberpunk documentary miniseries is here!

THE EVOLUTION OF CYBERPUNK covers novels, comics, animation, television, film, games, philosophy, hacking, VR, simulation theory and The Matrix phenomenon. Learn about the second trilogy from cyberpunk author William Gibson: Virtual Light, Idoru and All Tomorrow's Parties, and discover the brilliant satire and criticism of modern America in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.

Jack in to cyberspace with the origins of hacker culture, its impact on us during the advent of the internet, and how that informed our worldview of the information superhighway, and films such as The Net, Hackers and Johnny Mnemonic. What inspired us to invest so much into virtual reality, from the Virtual Boy, to injecting VR cameos into movies and shows like Serial Experiments Lain, Wild Palms, The Lawnmower Man, and others? And how did monumental video games such as System Shock, System Shock 2 and Bioforge influence us as players?

For the send-off, how did philosophy and existentialism surmount in such treasures as Philip K. Dick's novels and research, eXistenZ, Dark City, The Thirteenth Floor, and most notably of all, The Matrix? In summary, we will try to answer the eternal question, ""Are we living in a computer simulation?"".

For Zelda Month I decided replay my favorite Zelda game and what I didn't expect is that Majora's Mask helped me contextualize the snap lockdown Aotearoa New Zealand went into back in August, and through that I was able to understand the game in a way I never had before.

Thank you to @wizawhat @iamerror and @weighty for lending their voices for the project and @eurothug4000 @GCVazquez and Wizawhat for the script help. Also a huge up to @AmieWaters for the phenomenal music. All Majora's Mask footage was captured using Nerrel's HD Texture mod pack."

F.D Signifier has joined the creators over at Nebula!  You can help the channel and access the amazing content at Nebula as well as the streaming documentary service Curiosity stream by checking out the following link to sign up.  Watch to the end for more details on why this is such a great deal.


Dave Chappelle's most recent special ""The Closer"" has understandably left a lot of his long-time fans divided.  Many are dismayed at the relentlessly increasing use of jokes about trans people, others (most it seems) don't see the big deal and applaud Chappelle for ""standing up"" against cancel culture.

Regardless of where you stand, I feel like there's A LOT that almost everyone discussing this conflict is missing, and that many of the voices most affected by this conversation haven't had a chance to speak.

In this video, F.D tries to cut through the various layers of what's at stake here as he takes yet another of his heroes to task, but also tries to refine some of the parts of Chappelle's good points that are being missed in the backlash.

All of this on this episode of the Black Media Breakdown...

Today I'll be demonstrating some details meant to fall under the radar in the sound design of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. These little ""invisible"" design elements give an extra touch of grace to an already well-polished game, and they certainly indicate the inspiring passion of the game's developers!

Usually I'm up in the description being like, ""here are a bunch of things I wasn't really able to fit in the video"" but actually...turns out, if you let me go for 20 minutes, I get most of it out.

OK, I guess the one insight I had durning this that didn't fit is to do with righteous superiority. It (and fear) are most effective on people who struggle with self worth (which is to say...y'know...basically everyone, but also some people more than others.) In particular, people who might have been told that they would have a lot of status but then ended up not getting it might be very susceptible to both fear-based and superiority-based content. Interestingly, the fear and the superiority almost always go hand-in-hand. Like, ""here are the people you are superior to, and here is why you should be afraid of them"" is a wildly engaging thought.

Anyway, this is really intense and I hope we all get through it.

Is there anything better in videogames than that feeling of total freedom? Where you can go wherever you like, do whatever you want and become whoever you want to be - probably not. However, as much as the gaming community loves to feel like they're finding their own fun, the reality is a little more complicated.

See, when playing a game, we're never truly making our own decisions, and game designers must strike a constant balance between letting the player off the leash and making sure that their freedom actually means something. After a long trek through the desert and across the world, The Architect has managed to discover how the best, most liberating games of all manage to pull this trick off, and surprisingly, it's often by restricting players that the most empowering games work so well.

I guess I'm an Asian dad, now. I realize when I'm heavily invested in something I like, I'd start nitpicking it. That is the case here, too.
Shang-Chi, by and large, is a pretty good movie. But you probably already know that. Everybody is talking about it. So, today, I let me go for what I believe to be, the one thing Shang-Chi could've improved upon.

But… I also want to push that a little bit further… because there is a huge overlap between the autistic and transgender community… and I think that intersection often gets forgotten, especially in how transphobia is particularly destructive to neurodivergent and autistic trans folks, especially when it comes to this burnout.

This video could be seen as a spiritual follow up to the Black Escapism video. It covers a lot of the blowback The Boondocks received for daring to attempt a direct commentary on race relations and how many shows prior to it helped pave the way for its existence.

It serves as a reminder of where the show/strip came from, and a question regarding whether our policing of black media by black voices necessarily helps facilitate the prospect of anything surpassing it.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
SECRET MESSAGE:
► We should allow black voices to speak whatever reality is their own, because we have no idea what will stick and no idea will ultimately has us push things forward in terms of entertainment media."

"2QJuEq-tRGE","My Physicalmental Illness","vlogbrothers","2021-08-10","2021-08-10","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2QJuEq-tRGE/hqdefault.jpg","In which John discusses labyrinthitis, OCD, categories, the body in thought, and the body in pain.
TWO MAJOR NOTES:
1. Stigma is complicated. When it comes to stigma around mental illness, I've found this paper extremely helpful (I reread it often): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248273/ One heavily stigmatized illness not mention in the video is HIV, and there has been a lot of research around the causes (and the consequences) of stigma w/r/t HIV; I recommend this overview: https://www.icrw.org/publications/common-at-its-core-hiv-related-stigma-across-contexts/

But in general, illness is stigmatized partly based on our ability to treat them/our level of understanding, partly based on who tends to be most affected by them, and partly based on what the illness does and which bodily systems it affects (like, colon diseases are stigmatized in a way that heart diseases aren't). All of this has real impacts on health and healthcare delivery. Consider, for instance, this famous study showing racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment recommendations: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/)

2. This is largely coincidental, but I think it's interesting that it's possible to imagine a patient with OCD being treated with both the medications that were used to treat my labyrinthitis. Althought it is not widely administered, meclizine (which is primarily an anti-nausea medication; you may know it as dramamine or antivert) may have some ability to treat so-called ""diminished gating"" in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3895242/), and diazapam (commonly known in the U.S. as valium) is often prescribed to treat severe anxiety and panic attacks. (With regular use, patients often become tolerant to diazapam and/or physically dependent upon it, so it is often--or should be, anyway--prescribed with constraint and careful monitoring.)

"6ZKBX3fsaQ8","Can You Trust Science Too Much?","vlogbrothers","2021-08-02","2021-07-30","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ZKBX3fsaQ8/hqdefault.jpg","Science is a human-created process that is undergoing constant revision and it is the best tool we have for uncovering truth. It's not a bunch of facts, it's not an ideology. It's imperfect and influenced by bias, but it is also very good at decreasing the affects of bias.

Forcing science to stand up next to systems that use entirely different rules is super frustrating, and I have been very disheartened by how effective that has been for getting people to abandon expertise for some guy who has opinions.

But I am also frustrated by people who treat science like it's an ideology...who take whatever is the current consensus and attack people who want to add to it or challenge it as if they are anti-science or a political opponent.

The nice thing is that we do have lots of randomized controlled trials for several different vaccines so, like, let's definitely do that. But we also need to keep investigating anti-virals and treatments for sick people because, like, we're not out of the woods yet...

I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
I'm very sorry that you have to have a body

One that will hurt you and be the subject of so much of your fear
It will betray you
Be used against you
Then it will fail on you, my dear
But before that, you'll be a doormat
For every vicious narcissist in the world
Oh, how they'll screw you all up and over
Then feed you silence for dessert

I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
So very sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
I'm sorry that you have to have a body

Filled with infection
One hundred scabs
Singing in unison
Eyes and hands
Sometimes bullets
Uninvited
Passing through us

Uninvited
Passing through us

I'm sorry that you have to have a body
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body

K-Pop is celebrated across the world, but despite its glamorous appearance, its beautiful, stylish performers and highly produced optimistic pop music, there's an industry which routinely exploits its artists; physically, financially, emotionally. It destroys idol's lives in ways that are often irreversible. This video explores the hyper capitalistic nature of the industry, how artists are turned into commodities, and - like many other products - the glitzy exterior allows fans to ignore the human cost behind creating K-Pop

"jwwBHgl5zJo","Deep Sea Gigantism Explained","Natural World Facts","2021-05-31","2020-10-06","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jwwBHgl5zJo/hqdefault.jpg","Deep Sea Gigantism (abyssal gigantism) is defined as the the tendency for deep-sea animals to grow to much larger sizes than their shallow water relatives.

Watch the newer version of this film: https://youtu.be/FmR14Yng9kI

Biologists still aren’t certain why it is that some abyssal creatures grow to these immense sizes, for we have still only scratched the surface of discovery in the deep. But there are many theories, which may help to shed light on this mystery of the oceanic deep.

A brilliant example to show that deep sea fauna does indeed follow this rule, is the mollusk group, gastropods, which includes slugs and snails. In the deep, many species that are near symmetrical to shallower varieties, grow to be huge. The deep sea isopod belongs to a group that rarely grows larger than a few inches in the shadows, but down here they can grow to half a metre in length, and weigh approximately 1.7 kilograms. This variety, the giant isopod, is found in the deep, cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.

It looks to how they interface with the Monomyth template as originally laid down in 1949 by Joseph Campbell in The Hero With a Thousand Faces, one game conforming exactly to it and the next game violently rejecting the entire premise. It also discusses how Campbell's monomyth influenced the philosophies of the Jedi and Sith more than George Lucas might care to admit. Spoilers throughout.

I do talk about the recent rumours with HBO Max, but it's not until the end of the video, so it's basically a guarantee that the comments are going to be full of commenters telling me I didn't talk about things that I definitely did talk about. I know mocking knee-jerk comments in the description is pretty hack, but knee-jerk comments are also pretty hack, so a hack for a hack I guess.

A lot of what went into it flopping that way was impossible or misguided expectations of what the game actually was, what areas it would creatively focus on and even what genre it was.

Lyrics:

Seven times I left the world in heresy,
I would've notice, but I killed it in my sleep,
And it took you seven glances just to notice me,
I'm not quiet, I'm not broken, but it's all a mystery

Oh nobody knows, how long I've been waiting for death
Nobody knows, how long I've been waiting for death

This night ain't any different from the other ones you've seen,
A pretty girl in plastic and abandoned courtesy,
And this heart no it ain't broken, I noticed that last night,
As you walked out of the bar, with a man on your side

Oh this whiskey, every day and every night,
Oh these pills, every day and every night,
Make me feel, like I'm running out of light,
Like I'm running out of light, and state of mind

Well I packed my pipe with rum,
and I only left you some,
So we got no time to waste,
Cause' I ain't living if I ain't drunk

Oh nobody knows, how long I've been waiting for death
Nobody knows, how long I've been waiting for death

So we got some troubled times at last in Roanoke,
I spent my summers there but I'm not meant to call it home,
And for the record I was just about to run away from home,
But these jeans is gritted through, and this mind ain't meant to roam

And you said you can't believe, how I could just choose to be mean,
But you caught me in the deep, it won't last I'll be down on my knees

Oh this whiskey, every day and every night,
Oh these pills, every day and every night,
Make me feel, like I'm running out of light,
Like I'm running out of light, and state of mind

Well you said you think you're ready,
To be an actress, well I said it,
Life's just a rolling movie, and we're all waiting for the credits

Oh nobody knows, how long I've been waiting for death
Nobody knows, how long I've been waiting for death"

Correction: Existential psychology wasn't founded by Viktor Frankl (he just contributed his version which has been hugely influential for the last 70-80 years). Swiss psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger is probably the founder of the field of existential psychology. Thanks to commenter Kasper Fabricius Laursen for the correction.

This one was certainly long overdue. I had originally meant to get this video out, well, last year but couldn't. Free Huey's are the biggest time sync on the channel and they certainly are not easy to make from both a design and editing standpoint.

But, getting one out always fills me with a sigh of relief. I'm appriciative to be able to do this, and while this video is perhaps a lot more personal than the usual I do, I think it's important I talk about my experience dealing with this.

Learn about the Amy Krouse Rosenthal Foundation: https://www.amykrouserosenthalfoundation.org/

This video features an episode of the podcast ""The Anthropocene Reviewed"" in which John Green discusses his friendship with the writer Amy Krouse Rosenthal and the long, winding history of ""Auld Lang Syne,"" which has become the world's New Year's Eve song.

The clip at the end is from this video about Amy's 8/8/08 gathering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QVQSZA9zSk

This episode of the podcast was edited by Stan Muller, mixed by Joe Plourde, and scored by Hannis Brown. Jenny Lawton and Rosianna Halse Rojas produced.

The video is of water flowing in the White River, which flows southwest from Indianapolis into the Wabash River, and then into the Mississippi River, where it will meet with water that flowed from the Chicago River to the Des Plains River to the Illinois River and then to the Mississippi. In this way, the river that flowed near Amy's neighborhood will meet with the river that flowed through my neighborhood, which is something I think about sometimes when I feel very lonely.

A couple things that didn't make it into this video:
- For the early character/person discussion, one I spaced on was the one character from ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective."" You know the one. That the character slipped my mind speaks to how well they belong in that category, probably.
- There is a longitudinal study for how trans (and cis) kids develop, called the TransYouth project, so tracked data over time is on the way.
- I didn't catch the lack of neutral language in the 12th quote, I am sorry.

Also, I'd like to make a special mention of Catilin Koi's video ""Let's Talk About CATS"".
I wish I'd done my job a little better and found this video before I made my own, and cited her multiple times because she does a MUCH better job than I do at explaining the plot to the original stage version of Cats, especially everything with Grizabella at the end of the show.
if anything about this video has made you excited about learning about the original Cats then I cannot recommend her video enough

Final thoughts:
I wish I had instead mentioned a company besides Nintendo at the end. Their track record isn't great... for god's sake, Sakurai hooked himself up to an IV machine to keep working on smash. Would've been better to mention Supergiant games or something.

I'd like to thank Marty, Chris, Alex, Skymen, and everyone else who was willing to share their experience and insight. Y'all are the best, seriously.

Among Us is the hot new game right now - and who can blame it? It's tense, innovative and from a long tradition of games about lying to your friends, it's great. But what caused Among Us to become popular now? And what does any of that have in common with an old Russian psychology experiment from the 80s?

Fresh from another killing spree, The Architect is determined to find out why, and that's going to mean delving into murder mysteries, our modern-day political landscape, and the truth behind why we enjoy hidden role games to find out the truth behind Among Us' surprising rise to fame.

Shot at Silent Barn in Brooklyn

Lyrics:
Held in a bong hit, sitting in a
Hot tub in south Wisconsin. I feel
Amazing when I'm all alone
Switching between porn and Robocop
Turned off my cellphone, drank a bottle
Of wine and read a Cometbus and
Passed out naked, shriveling, stumbled
To bed in a fucked up sleepwalk
I got so tired of discussing my future
I've started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea.
I read the worst thing ever in a bathrobe of off-white terricloth,
Translated by technology from your voice extremely inaccurately.
I got so tired of discussing my future
I've started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can't throw up.
I got so tired of discussing my future
That I walk through my life like I'm the only one
With evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can't throw up.
Cleaned up the empty bottles.
Let the smoke out through chilly windows.
I used the stationary bike
I watched the end of The Price Is Right
Ordered an egg-white sandwich and I
Drove south through mid-day traffic and I
Called up some folks I truly love and
Hung up after they said hello.
I got so tired of discussing my future
I've started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can't throw up.
I got so tired of discussing my future
That I walk through my life like I'm the only one
With evenings of silence and mornings of nausea.

What does Coco's story say about those systems? And what are the circumstances that lead me to only say the name ""Miguel"" twice in a 40 min video about Coco? All these questions and more will be answered in this overly-long, overly-personal exploration of the systems in Coco and their equivalent in the real-world.


A big thank you to my sister for her help on some of the graphics. Everything that looks shockingly professional was her doing and everything that looks laughably amateurish was my doing.

It attempts to describe a game that makes a herculean effort to thwart description. To do so, I try to go through some of the main themes and artisitic methodologies present in the work and try to argue that even the weirdest things in this game deserve to be there. Maybe especially the weirdest things. Spoilers throughout.

Goals and rewards can be a great way to motivate players to learn, try out features, and play longer - but in certain circumstances, they can actually backfire on you. To find out more, let's jump into the psychology of motivation.

Accented Cinema - Episode 44

To most people, the live action Mulan film is just a boring, soulless war movie. But to me, it is an insulting experience. I can forgive it for all the inaccuracies in depicting Chinese culture. But I cannot forgive this film for what it did to the character of Mulan: Turning her into a symbol of submission.

**Apart Together** (Lyrics)

KCRW
On the way to a show
Heard the story of an elderly couple
Found dead in their mobile home
They’d been there a month they say
Seemed to be no decay
I guess the upside of freezing to death
Is that you tend to stay that way
Locked in each other’s arms
Eyes closed and faces calm
They may have lain there ‘til spring
If it weren’t for the ping of their smoke alarm
God sure works in mysterious ways
Died of power bills left unpaid
Found by a neighbour who heard the ping
Dropped around offering
Double As

I think this could last forever
Girl let’s fall apart together

I can handle the entropy
If you promise to stay with me
I give you my heart knowing things fall apart
Praying you will decay with me

Locked in each other’s arms
Eyes closed and faces calm
In the morning a new life will dawn
So maybe don’t set the alarm

Baby I think this could last forever
Girl let’s fall apart together
Girl let’s fall apart together

Well, I'm leaving from Kentucky.
I've been weathered through the skin
and I have my suspicions that I won't see you again.
I have found no mercy in these old bourbon hills.
The wind has always been a part of my life
and I can feel it still.

Rest in peace to the me that you had in your head.
It took a little long, but the fantasy is finally gone.

I'm calling you from Cleveland
selling war bonds door to door
and even Dusseldorf to Stalingrad
know what you've got in store.
The scenery won't change until you die.
The scenery won't change and nor will I.
Uncle Sam, don't make me fly across the Rhine."

"-Iwu-nuaNd8","Stereotype Threat in Education and Gaming | Patron Topic Pick!","Cass Eris","2020-08-29","2020-08-28","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Iwu-nuaNd8/hqdefault.jpg","Let's talk about stereotype threat, in its usual research space as well as applying it to gaming.

The review paper is linked below, and provided the structure for the first half of the video. It's a good jumping off point for deeper research if this video was interesting.

I tried to make the latter parts of the video more inclusive, but a lot of the research (and discourse) has focused on women. Apologies to my non-binary viewers.

This part wasn't included in the video for flow, but I want to put out here that two of the three disciplines I was interested in going into were because of media portrayal of women in the sciences. Archaeology was a combination of dinosaurs just being cool plus Indiana Jones, and little me not understanding the difference. The shift to wanting to do marine biology happened after seeing ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"", and the shift to physics came after seeing ""Contact."" I'm definitely an example of media encouraging me to at least try to pursue STEM careers.

You ever wish you could erase your memory for the sole purpose of being able to replay certain games again for the first time? Yeah? Thought so. For me, I would give almost anything to play Breath of the Wild, Shadow of the Colossus, and Outer Wilds again for the first time again. The bigger issue is that I barely even feel like I can replay these games at all, despite them being three of my favorites of all time. So, in this video, I dive into why these games don't feel replayable to me, and pour one out for the games I wish I could play again for the first time.

It's easy to assume that amazing indie games like Gunpoint, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Ape Out, and Into the Breach were designed in a flash of inspiration. But that's not true - find out how these games came to be in this episode of Game Maker's Toolkit.

I think this is an interesting quote by Rebecca Chaiklin that really shows how they viewed their participants: ""We were blessed in this project in having subjects that were obsessed with filming themselves. Narcissism was a common thread, and all of them constantly wanting to be on camera was every filmmaker’s dream,” Chaiklin said. “So there was this plethora of footage, and it was just the gift that kept on giving for us.""

Lyrics:
The existential threat that I always feel
Nothing's happened yet today and yet I have to feel
Danger near, danger here
Nowhere to escape to and nobody there to hear as I now
Scream in fear, scream in fear
The existential threat is drawing very, very near and they all
Look away, look away
Can't they see the existential threat is on its way
The existential threat that I tend to feel
When I'm walking down the street or right behind the wheel
Turning left, turning right
Trying to escape the cloud that's close enough to feel and you may
Laugh out loud, laugh out loud
The existential threat is always hanging about and you may
Say go way, say go way
The existential threat is never going away
Doctor gave me these, I said what are these?
He said that they'll cure an existential type disease
Doubt they will, doubt they will
But I'm keen to try whatever, gimme that pill and he said
Here's the bill, here's the bill
In the end they didn't work, I paid the whole bill because
Insurance won't, they just won't
Cover existential meds, I wish I had known
How should I react under this attack
Even when I'm standing up I feel I'm on my back
Quagmire here, quagmire there
I cannot elucidate the danger that is always there but it is
Looming large, extra large
My semi-automatic weapon ready to discharge but it's a
Futile act, better pack
The existential threat is bulletproof and looming large
Sartre and Camus seemed to understand
Something close to what I'm feeling though they were in France
Deux Magots they would go
Each comparing existential threats they came to blows and then
The crowds came near just to cheer
For the greatest existential threatened philosophe and it is
Comforting, comforting
Then the comfort starts to very quickly fade away
Did I wake you up, sorry if I did
Guess I woke you up and also woke your little kid
Threat outside, let me hide
Just until the danger passes, then I'll go outside and have to
Come again, once again
The existential threat is at your patio door and do not
Let it in, let it in
When you fight the existential threat you will not win
The existential threat that I always feel
Lots of things have happened and I seek an even keel
Danger near, danger far
Nowhere to escape to and I'm racing in my car as I now
Scream in fear, scream in fear
The existential threat is drawing very, very near as I now
Drive away, by the way
Can't you see the existential threat is on its way"

Footnotes

[1] This role could also be played by the character Kaidan Alenko, depending on who survived the events of Mass Effect 1. To streamline the video, I’m using Ashley whenever I need to talk about the “Virmire survivor”.

[2] There are other possible choices, one of which involves using a ""Charm"" or ""Intimidate"" line to get Tali off scot-free without presenting the evidence. This is just one of many examples of the rewards for playing pure Paragon or pure Renegade being far too tempting…

"LM7z7pDmEC4","Why Some Cops Think They're The Punisher","José","2020-06-21","2020-06-20","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LM7z7pDmEC4/hqdefault.jpg","This is a brief video on why cops are wearing The Punisher's logo. I had wanted to go into a few other things, such as how a certain right wing militia also used the logo, though I was worried it would have gotten a bit off track.

For the record, I do enjoy The Punisher as a character in limited amounts, but I've always found the fandom around the character to be problematic. Some of the comments from police and military personnel in particular were worrying. I only shared a few in this video, but far too many people see this morally grey (at best) character as some ultimate arbiter of right and wrong. The idea of a deeply flawed man somehow being perfect at dispensing final justice seems like wish fulfillment in a lot of ways, so I can understand why someone would want to believe that. I think it would be better for people to raise their aspirations a little higher though, looking at character who reshape the world, instead of transforming themselves into something above it all.

In September of 1940, an 18-year-old mechanic named Marcel Ravidat was walking his dog, Robot, in the countryside of Southwestern France when the dog disappeared down a hole. Robot eventually returned but the next day, Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole.

And after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a wooly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave. It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.

But, most recently, Lisa Hanawalt's characters have carved a new space in the public consciousness for animal people - from her work as production designer on the Netflix series BoJack Horseman, and as the creator of Tuca and Bertie as well as independent comics - and I think it's these characters, more than any others, that are most able to both distance us and bring us closer to being human.

"ByRKF1INOcU","Atomic Pilgrimage: Ghost Towns, Nuclear Relics, and Lost Civilizations on the Road to Trinity Site","Noah Caldwell-Gervais","2020-04-08","2019-06-07","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ByRKF1INOcU/hqdefault.jpg","This is a video travelogue about a 40-day, 40-night road trip to the Trinity Site, where the first atomic bomb in history was detonated in the summer of 1945. It goes much farther than that, covering many other atomic destinations and driving deep into the natural and social history of the American southwest. If you'd like to see a simulated nuclear missile launch, a forest of stone pillars, Oregon's only geyser, and a 60-foot tall neon cowboy all in the same video, this would likely be your jam. The trip was done over 6500 miles in a 1973 Volkswagen bus in the spring of 2019.

The one thing that I'm expecting someone in the comments is going to latch onto is the exact timeline of the abolition of serfdom in Europe because it was very much not a uniform thing and the process took a couple hundred years to encompass the entire continent. It's a super big and complex subject because it encompasses both the fallout of the Black Death and various technological developments. But some of those developments were, themselves, responses to the plague, built to solve problems it created. Ultimately I chose a super simplified, ultra-compressed version of history because the story of history is ultimately the story of the present. We can come out of this crisis better than we went in.

It bases anthropomorphic animals and gives them real human emotions, problems, and politics. Legoshi is particularly unique in that his carnivore status mixed with his kind and empathetic heart is heavily entwined with the topic of privilege. But it's not just Legoshi, Haru and Louis, really every character resembles some sociopolitical position. It's something new, and it's worth checking out.

A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with the video. Especially “Our World in Data”, the online publication for research and data on the world’s largest problems – and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona Pandemic.

In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the “Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2”, that causes the disease called COVID19, and that everyone simply calls Coronavirus.

What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do?

LYRICS

A dark and moonless night
Has never felt so right
An empty mirror only shows what's left inside
Lost in the city street
Electric tapestry
The neon beckons me beyond its ghostly light

No longer I pretend
The staircase I descend
Will lead me anywhere but my unscripted end
My heart and hands collide
The gun lays at my side
Too late to turn back, only fate’s left to decide

Magnum bullets
Settling a score
Magnum bullets
Kicking down the door

Back up the stairs again
I am a different man
A broken mirror only shows as best it can
Running in shoes that shine
With blood that isn't mine
A staining trophy of the battles I've survived

No longer I defend
The choices I pretend
Could make amends that heal the loss of precious time
My conscience paralyzed
Against the rising tide
Of haunting memories that drown a wasted life

Magnum bullets
Always wanting more
Magnum bullets
Closing every door

--------------------
Well if I found god anywhere, it would be by the tracks
Face down in a box car, forty in both hands
And when I find god there, we'll just sit and roll some top
Cause he'll be just as confused as anyone else on this rock

I took two tabs of acid yesterday afternoon
And I woke up this morning with a torn pair of shoes
And found I'd ruined my life and everyone else's too
I guess this is what my teachers warned me drugs would do

But they forgot to mention the way
That the morphine makes the pain go away
And how I'll always remember the good times in my spine
And the holes I burned in my brain with this next line

If I found satan anywhere it would be by the tracks
Trading souls of kids like me for cheap bags of smack
When I find satan there you know I won't be thinking twice
Cause at least in hell there's rock 'n roll and ain't no jesus christ

And I swear I left my sanity someplace in this mess
Crumpled between empty beers and packs of cigarettes
Kick my last hope to pieces and just hope for the best
I guess this is why my friends warned me against hopelessness

But they're the one's getting laid
And I'm the one waking up lonely every single day
And I'll remember that as I listen to their crap
And tell them to fuck off, then hug them after that

Well if I found god anywhere it would be by the tracks
Huffin whippits down as he watches the trains pass
When I find god there I'll watch him pass out throwning up
Cause he's drank himself to sleep every night since the one that he made us"

While we are focusing on games this time, hopefully after watching you'll be able to see how these same ideas can apply to movies, books and even places like museums!


UPDATE: 27/04/20!!!
I was just made aware of this project that offers an alternative to racial bonuses in DnD 5e that looks super interesting, it's free to download but you can donate to support the author and artist, which I would really recommend you do!

Click your favorite story beat from Alan Dean Foster’s upcoming Episode XI treatment:
The film opens with a long funeral for Kylo Ren at which C-3PO gives a long, sentimental speech https://www.patreon.com/JennyNicholson
Finn selects his second in command, secretary, and treasurer and Poe’s name doesn’t come up in the conversation for any of these jobs https://twitter.com/JennyENicholson
Rose and Paige Tico are revealed to have a third heretofore unknown sister, who also explodes https://www.twitch.tv/progamerjenny
The new Tico sister has a 20-minute onscreen funeral at which R2-D2 and BB-8 say a few words https://www.instagram.com/spider_jewel/
Luke comes back from the dead a second time, explaining that he simply had to exert twice as much Force power to do so, and they reattach his missing hand so that he can wield three lightsabers at once https://spiderjewel.tumblr.com/
Rey sobs https://www.facebook.com/JennyNicholsonVids/

I called it a pitch in the title even though it’s just a hypothetical treatment because everyone understands what a pitch is but not everyone immediately understands what a treatment is, and also pitch has fewer characters."

In this video, I'm talking about how this game managed to be the first video game that gave me the feeling of playing a tabletop campaign with an actual DM. And many other shenanigans.

In this Discourse, Tom Scott talks about science communication in the age of social media, how to be popular on the internet, and dealing with a world where view counts are often more important than truth.

Watch the Q&A: https://youtu.be/ZIv4tqJNuxs

Tom Scott is a British entertainer, educator, YouTuber, web developer and former presenter of 'Gadget Geeks' on Sky One. He graduated from the University of York with a degree in linguistics. He has a popular YouTube channel with over 1.6 million subscribers and more than 325 million video views as of June 2019.

In more than fifteen years of publishing on the internet, Tom has visited the High Arctic, passed out in a centrifuge, and somehow got three million people to watch a video about why the British plug is a great invention.

This talk and Q&A was filmed in the Ri on 27 September 2019.

There were many painful cuts in this video's contents, so if you were a fan of the show and are upset I didn't really go into deal about certain aspects of its nine season run, it was either because I didn't have time to fit them in or couldn't find anything interesting to say about them.

This video is probably best understood in the context of the second one I have planned in the future. It probably would have made more sense to just make that one, but I love long winded intros that set the stage. This video even has two of them.

Dr. Philip Zimbardo, the psychologist behind the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment, now runs seminars to teach everyday people how to be heroes.  But can heroism be learned?  I put his unsuspecting students into a fake crisis situation to see if they would act heroically.  Also, I asked employees to help me run a seemingly dangerous experiment, to see if they would blow the whistle to stop me.

For the last year and a half, Hank and I have been working on a big, long-term project with Partners in Health Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone has the highest maternal mortality rate in the world, and one of the highest child mortality rates, and we believe that can change with long-term investments in Sierra Leone's healthcare system. The project will be announced later this month, and this video explores some of the why.

Thanks to Jon Lascher at Partners in Health for the pictures of the Koidu Government Hospital before PIH arrived, and for taking a look at this script. Thanks also to Rosianna Halse Rojas for her help with images and editorial guidance. Any mistakes are mine alone.

They're very good at catching bugs and hiding and very bad at building nests. They mate for life and, in places where there are cars, they are very good at getting hit by them because they fly toward the bugs that are illuminated by headlights. Dangit.

This video has been ""done"" for a while now, but I had a lot of trouble finishing it owing to a lingering sickness in my lungs that has made it difficult to record vocals that don't sound froggy and gross. Aside from that bit of TMI I do want to stress that I really love Minecraft, I love creative games, I love construction games, I love logistics games. All of the game footage in this video is mine. I have it because I own all these games and have played them all for somewhere between dozens and hundreds of hours each.

"zhESYHHbzsc","The Amazon isn't ""Burning"" - It's Being Burned","vlogbrothers","2019-08-23","2019-08-23","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zhESYHHbzsc/hqdefault.jpg","This is a thing that is happening right now, and (taking a page from the global warming playbook) a think I've been hearing from Bolsonaro's supporters is, ""Who even knows how bad it is...deforestation is actually down.""

It's so sad to watch us play with words and numbers when the reality is obvious to anyone with eyes. ""Deforestation"" is down because when you don't count burning, and we don't know how much land has been burned because it's still burning and determining the extent of a forest fire is extremely labor intensive. It takes time to do these surveys. But what we do know for sure is that the number of fires is up all over the Amazon.

And we also know that Bolsonaro's government had decreased inspections dramatically, put military officials in charge of environmental organizations, and fired every scientist who publicly disagrees with him.

There has never been a greater reminder that nationalism is a disaster of an ideology, and that how we imagine the world and who we end up voting for matters. A lot.

While there's something to be said for separating the art from the artist, I think there's a lot of merit in CONTEXTUALIZING the art WITH the artist. Did Lovecraft write some pretty incredible horror? Sure! Was he also a raging xenophobe? Absolutely! Are his perspectives on life connected with the stories he felt compelled to tell? Duh! If you look at Lovecraft's writing through the lens of his life, clear patterns emerge that allow us to pin down what exactly he built his horror cosmology out of. It's an invaluable analytical tool that allows us to take apart his writings by getting inside his head. So before you yell at me for Not Separating The Artist From The Art, know that it was completely intentional and I'm not sorry.

On a narrative level The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about the power of hope in the face of extraordinary hardship. But underpinning Andy Dufresne’s story we also find a blistering critique of the prison system and criminal justice policy in the United States.

The second season of HBO's Westworld is a bit of a mess. An epic, beautiful, erratic, needlessly complicated mess that doesn't quite live up to the amazing first season. And that's because of one thing: it focuses so much on plot twists and gotcha moments that it forgets its most important asset: the characters.

Because discussions of climate change are often so very dire, I do end this video on a positive note. That's something I went back and forth on a lot. Ultimately, what we're dealing with here isn't simple in terms of causes, problems, or solutions. We do see that economics are already making renewables more attractive. That is the path of least resistance, but it is also the slowest way to go.

We need governments to take action but that is an extremely tall order with a global crisis and competitive nations. Will this ultimately be a force that drives us apart? Or will it be something that brings us together.

There is actually a more positive way of looking at the outcome of Game of Thrones thus far...a common enemy brought an end to some, but not all petty squabbling. And maybe the unification brought by an external threat created an alliance that will show that one last squabbler a very bad time.

Lyrics

Goodbye Mr. A

There's a hole in your logic
You who know all the answers (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You claim science ain't magic (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And expect me to buy it

Goodbye Mr. A
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much
Goodbye Mr. A
You had all the answers but no human touch

If life is subtraction
Your number is odd
Your love is a fraction
It's not adding up

So busy showing me where I'm wrong
You forgot to switch your feelings on, (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
So, so superior, are you not
You love a little bit but you forgot

Goodbye Mr. A
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much
Goodbye Mr. A
You had all the answers but no human touch

If life is subtraction
Your number is odd
Your love is a fraction
It's not adding up

Goodbye Mr. A
Goodbye Mr. A

Goodbye Mr. A
The world was full of wonder until you opened my eyes
Goodbye Mr. A
Wish you hadn't blown my mind and killed the surprise

Goodbye Mr. A
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much
Goodbye Mr. A
You had all the answers but no human touch

Your life is subtraction
Your number is odd
Your love is a fraction
It's not adding up"

If you want to know one thing about making a machinima in Fortnite it's that it's super, super rad when you spend several hours late at night setting up footage in your virtual digital studio with the intent that you'll record the properly-composed shots in replay mode in the morning, only to wake up to a minor patch that breaks all your replays. It's extra rad when this happens three days in a row.

Ubisoft would have you believe that The Division 2 makes no political statements while it exploits political imagery for marketing purposes.

In another case of the game industry wanting it both ways, games claim to be apolitical but are more than happy to talk about governments, terrorists, and civil unrest.

It's dishonest and it's craven. Even a game desperately trying to say nothing is, through such desperation, saying something. In fact, it's saying a lot.

Subscribe to The Anthropocene Reviewed: https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/anthropocene-reviewed

Topics range from Kentucky bluegrass to the Taco Bell breakfast menu to Lascaux cave paintings.

Hailed as a “rare literary talent” by 60 Minutes, John is a No. 1 New York Times bestselling author. John’s books have been translated into 55 languages, and in 2014, he was named to TIME’s list of the 100 most influential people for his “curiosity, compassion, grace, and excitement.”

“At some point last year, my world had begun to feel unsustainably busy and loud,” said John Green. “I started The Anthropocene Reviewed in response to that feeling. Every month I review two facets of the human-centered planet in an attempt to think carefully, and even a little quietly, about the world we’ve built for ourselves. By paying extremely close attention to almost anything, I think we can learn about the universe and our place in it.”

The next episode comes out on Nov. 15, 2018. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.

Newt Scamander, protagonist of the Harry Potter spinoff, is an unconventional male hero. He performs a refreshingly atypical form of masculinity, especially for the lead in a fantasy adventure story.

Why is that and how does beauty affect our subconscious?

This video was a collaboration with the creative agency Sagmeister & Walsh as a contribution to their upcoming Beauty exhibition at the MAK Vienna from October 23rd onwards. If you want to learn more about the impact of beauty and see tons of gorgeous installations and multi-media objects, go check it out on https://www.mak.at/en_sagmeister_walsh
The Beauty exhibition will also be shown in the Museum Angewandte Kunst Frankfurt from May 11th till September 15th.

Viewer discretion is advised. If you don't want to hear me talk politics then skip this one. Also I cut most of this one in one night due to time constraints so if the editing is a little less finessed than usual that's why, haha. If you're wondering why I cut some stuff short or didn't include something that's because it was already 35 minutes long which is too long

I'M BACK (again).  Now, onto the two orders of business...

Firstly, I just noticed a few months ago that I surpassed the 10,000 subscriber threshold, so I wanted to take a moment to thank all of you who have supported me by watching and/or commenting on my videos.  I was trying to think of something neat and unique to do as a token of my appreciation, and I finally decided to use my incredible artistic abilities to draw a picture for anyone who comments on this video within the next 24 hours.  Just tell me what to draw and I will draw it for you with Da Vincian-like prowess.  (This may or may not turn out to be a horrible idea.)

Secondly, I've decided that it's time to change my channel name.  Not because juvenile euphemisms for flatulence and feces are not funny (because they are), but because it's kind of embarrassing to tell people my channel name in real life.  So after much consideration, I've decided that my new channel name will be...:

*drumroll*

POOT McTOOT.  Just kidding, actually I've decided to just go with ""PPF Music.""  But before I officially change it, I'd like your feedback and/or suggestions for alternate name changes.  So if you have any opinions regarding this pressing matter, feel free to post away."

"LKPwKFigF8U","Why Boredom is Good For You","Veritasium","2018-10-04","2018-09-29","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LKPwKFigF8U/hqdefault.jpg","Boredom makes you more creative, altruistic, introspective, and helps with autobiographical planning.
This video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2wAsdUu

I feel like this video might come across as condescending but the person I'm really talking to is myself. Despite the fact that I know how useful it can be to be bored, I still find myself trying to fill every last moment with stimulus. Boredom is unpleasant - the open, unstructured thinking that can take place can also feel pointless. But now I'm made this video to remind myself how important boredom is so hopefully I'll make more time to be bored.

Correction: At 1:49, we accidentally said that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was published in 1918, when it was published in 1818. We regret the error -- thanks to Stephen Pershing for catching this!

Stories, tales, and myths from all around the world posing speculative questions around technologies have existed long before Ray Bradbury and Frank Herbert, from the time-traveling Japanese fairy tale ""Urashima Tarō” to some of the speculative elements of 1001 Arabian Nights.  But there are a few eras that begin to shape what we’ve come to know as science fiction today.

“Young Adult” fiction is a term whose meaning has varied wildly over the years. It can apply to coming of age tragedies or Serialized adventures of babysitters, or insert really dated twilight joke here. But where did this “young adult” genre come from? And why did it get so big?

iTunes: http://goo.gl/n4EgkZ | Bandcamp: http://goo.gl/gDetLT
I can't remember feeling so passionate whilst writing something in ages.   I absolutely love a lot of the subjects I mention in this - astronomy, particle physics, pure maths... but I hate that everyone is forced to learn them.   It should be a choice.   There are a million other things wrong with education, but this one stood out as the most obvious and most insane.

The point of this song is to get people talking - if you share it, use #DontStayInSchool so we can all get involved in the conversation.

Lyrics:
I wasn’t taught how to get a job
but I can remember dissecting a frog
I wasn’t taught how to pay tax
but I know loads about Shakespeare's classics

I was never taught how to vote
they devoted that time to defining isotopes
I wasn’t taught how to look after my health
but mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell

Never spent a lesson on current events
instead I studied The Old American West
I was never taught what laws there are.
I was never taught what laws there are.

Let me repeat - I was not taught the laws for the country I live in,
but I know how Henry the VIII killed his women.
Divorced beheaded died, divorced beheaded survived
glad that’s in my head instead of financial advice

I was shown the wavelengths of different hues of light
but I was never taught my human rights
 Apparently there’s 30, do you know them?   I don’t
Why the hell can’t we both recite them by rote?!

I know igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks
Yet I don’t know squat about trading stocks
Or how money works at all - where does it come from?
Who controls it?   How does the thing that motivates the world function?

not taught how to budget and disburse my earnings
I was too busy rehearsing cursive.
Didn’t learn how much it costs to raise a kid or what an affidavit is
but I spent days on what the quadratic equation is

negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared
minus 4ac over 2a
That’s insane, that’s absolutely insane.
They made me learn that over basic first aid

How to recognise the most deadly Mental disorders // or
diseases with preventable causes // How to buy a
house with a mortgage // if I could afford it
 ‘cause abstract maths was deemed more important

than advice that would literally save thousands of lives
but it’s cool, ‘cause now I could tell you if the number of unnecessary deaths caused by that choice was prime.

Never taught present day practical medicines,
but I was told what the ancient hippocratic method is
“I’ve got a headache, the pain is ceaseless
what should I take?” umm... maybe try some leeches?

“Could we discuss domestic abuse and get the facts
or how to help my depressed friend with their mental state?”
Ummm... no  but learn mental maths
because “you won’t have a calculator with you every day!”

They say it’s not the kids, the parents are the problem
Then if you taught the kids to parent that’s the problem solved then!
All this advice about using a condom
but none for when you actually have a kid when you want one

I’m only fluent in this language, for serious?
The rest of the world speaks two, do you think I’m an idiot?
They chose the solar over the political system
So like a typical citizen now I don’t know what I’m voting on

which policies exist, or how to make them change
mais oui, je parle un peu de Francais
So at 18, I was expected to elect a representative
For a system I had never ever ever ever been presented with

But I won’t take it
I’ll tell everyone my childhood was wasted
I’ll share it everywhere how I was “educated”
And insist these pointless things

Sponsor: http://skl.sh/nerdcity2 - 2 free months

- Due to regulations being stricter for children's content, most broadcasters are very careful when stating what demographic a show is intended for.
- Jake Paul says that his target demo is ages 8-16.
- Jake, his brother Logan Paul, and his Team 10 employees regularly collaborate with family channels and babies who make content for the Youtube Kids app.
- According to the American Psychological Association, younger viewers are uniquely vulnerable to advertising, and have difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality.
- Jake spends up to 50% of his videos doing ad reads and plugs for his products, and using ""pester power"" to sell products.
- The content on Jake Paul Vlogs features violent and sexual content not suitable for ages 13 and below.
- Jake Paul's merch is littered with clip-art.
- His new ""high-end"" fashion line (""rise and Be Original"") RNBO uses free font CharBB as the logo.

Ready Player One is filled with pop culture easter eggs, and yet it still feels surprisingly empty. Today, I take a look at how the decisions made when adapting the film affected the themes of the story, and why the filmmakers could have gone further to address the issues of the source material.

A friend of mine who is really into movies picked out a bunch of clips for me to interrogate. Some movies I had seen before, and others I hadn't. See how Hollywood does with some hardcore physics!

Wow! Thank you so much for supporting the Real Doctor Reacts to series. I said that if you get the grey's anatomy video to 15k likes I'll do another episode and you CRUSHED it by getting it 200k+ likes. I dove into the comments section to see what medical tv drama you wanted me to review next and it seemed like the good doctor was the obvious choice. Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =]

Full disclosure, I have never watched an episode of the good doctor on ABC so I decided to go ahead and start my tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( good doctor 1x01 ) of the series. I was really curious myself to see if the good doctor is a medically accurate show.

I really did enjoy this medical tv show because I think it did a lot of things well. It gave an interesting look into what life is like a for a surgeon and a resident. Being a surgical resident is not an easy job and to make the situation even more complex Dr. Sean Murphy has autism so they did a great job of breaking down these circumstances.

I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor / Real Doctor Reacts to the Good Doctor. If you want me to continue making this tv medical drama series please like the video and leave me a comment on which medical tv show or episode you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

They attack political critique most boisterously in the context of reviews, but also in most other contexts as well. But is that really a fair position to take?  Can we take video games in a vacuum, divorced from the developers and the greater context which created them?

(Sorry about the video quality on this one. I screwed up creating the project in Premiere, finished editing it, realized that this version of Premiere has no way to correct the configuration error. A stupid mistake, but not one I seem to be able to meaningfully correct without re-editing the video which would take several days. Next video should, in theory, not look this horrible in motion.)

This video summary has more asides than actual content, so I figured I'd add this sentence in an effort to make it look more substantial."

I’ve intended for a very long time to cut an essay on parasocial relationships. After researching the subject on and off for months I realized I would either have to put together something very, very, long and dense even by my standards OR split it up into smaller parts. I feel like this is a subject that benefits from being split up into distinct sections so here is part one of a four-part series on parasocial relationships. An overwhelming amount of academic research has been done on this subject so I might end up making more than four videos depending on what I find, but for now four is a conservative estimate in the interest of not spreading the information too thin.

All of the background music on this one is Lemon Demon :)

"ft4x8vM0748","My Giant Robot Suit","vlogbrothers","2018-08-10","2018-08-10","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ft4x8vM0748/hqdefault.jpg","I don't think having a following on the internet means you have to never engage or defend yourself. But I think that you have to behave differently than you would if you didn't have a following. And I know that thinking about this from the perspective of the person in the robot suit is like, ""Oh, boo hoo, you're rich and famous I'm so sorry someone was mean to you once."" But now that the internet exists, occasionally the once infathomable distance between a few people chatting in their social space and a super mainstream celebrity, occasionally collapses to literally no distance at all.

Celebrities don't feel like anything more than people...they look in the mirror and see their soft, squishy bodies. So when they walk in on a group of people saying terrible things, it's understandable that they would react. But those people are seeing the robot suit, not the person.

But I think we should realize that we're all wearing robot suits these days, and that we're all a lot more powerful than we think we are. It's very easy to go too hard these days, whether you've been building your suit for a decade or whether you're just a simple quiet person with a Twitter account.

this is something different. i hope you guys like it. this song is a confession and an apology. honest, not sarcastic.

music and lyrics by bo burnham.

lyrics

art is dead, art is dead
art is dead, art is dead

entertainers like to seem complicated
but we're not complicated
i can explain it pretty easily
have you ever been to a birthday party for children
and one of the children won't stop screaming
cause he's just a little attention attractor
when he grows up to be a comic or actor
he'll be rewarded for never maturing
for never understanding or learning
that every day can't be about him
there's other people you selfish asshole

i must be psychotic, i must be demented
to think that i'm worthy of all this attention,
of all of this money you worked really hard for
i slept in late while you worked at the drug store.
my drug's attention, i am an addict
but i get paid to indulge in my habit
it's all an illusion, i'm wearing make-up
i'm wearing make-up, make-up, make-up, make-up

art is dead, so people think you're funny
how do you get those people's money?
art is dead, we're rolling in dough
while Carlin rolls in his grave, in his grave, in his grave.

this show has got a budget
the show has got a budget
and all the poor people way more deserving of the money won't budge it
cause i wanted my name in lights
when i could have fed a family of four
for forty fucking fortnights, forty fucking fortnights

i am an artist, please god forgive me
i am an artist, please don't revere me
i am an artist, please don't respect me
i am an artist, feel free to correct me
a self-centered artist, self-obsessed artist
i am an artist, i am an artist

but i'm just a kid, i'm just a kid, kid
and maybe i'll grow out of it"

Trap trap trap till the cage is full

In the dark, count mistakes
The light was off, but now it's on
Searching underground for a bit of sun
The sun is out, the day is new
And everyone is waiting, waiting on you
And you've got time

Think of all the roads
Think of all their crossings
Taking steps is easy
Standing still is hard
Remember all their faces
Remember all their voices
Everything is different

SEMIOTICS

A good place to start is Folding Ideas' (really old) video on signs and memes: https://youtu.be/rs0sybzUu24

Here's a whole site on it when you wanna go more in depth: http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/

DEATH OF THE AUTHOR

I'd say the best place to start would be the essay ""Greatly Exaggerated"" by David Foster Wallace, but it's, sadly, not online. It's in this book: https://www.amazon.com/Supposedly-Fun-Thing-Never-Again/dp/0316925284

Here's a rundown of the essay: http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Greatly_Exaggerated

Here's Roland Barthes original essay that coined the phrase: http://www.tbook.constantvzw.org/wp-content/death_authorbarthes.pdf

And here's Michel Foucault's expansion of the theory: http://www.movementresearch.org/classesworkshops/melt/Foucault_WhatIsAnAuthor.pdf

ENUNCIATION THEORY

The best way to acquaint yourself with enunciation theory is to read through the glossary of Casetti's Inside the Gaze: https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Gaze-Fiction-Spectator-Translation/dp/0253334438

...but here's an article on it: https://francescocasetti.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/filmtheoryandenunciation.pdf

Jurassic Park is a great example of how theme can be used to design a cohesive and powerful story. Author Michael Crichton and screenwriter David Koepp use the theme as the DNA of the story, creating interesting characters with opposing viewpoints that explore the question at the heart of the film: Is everything we call “progress” actually progress?

Convenient, job creating, but more than willing it seems to not so much break the rules as completely disregard them.

If you want to know how to create a billion dollar company in eight years, it seems Uber’s response might be ‘any way you can.’

Nier Automata was The Architect's favourite game of last year. Not because of its gameplay, or even because of 2B's sexy thighs, but because of its groundbreaking approach to philosophy and the art of games.

In a departure from the norm, The Architect gives you a crash course on reading a game from a literary perspective. Yeah this totally what all the people who subscribed because of the 40k video wanted.

"-Z0S0Z8lUTg","The Philosophy of Kreia: A Critical Examination of Star Wars","ִ","2018-06-10","2017-05-04","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Z0S0Z8lUTg/hqdefault.jpg","The character Kreia from the game Knights of the Old Republic 2 is arguably one of the greatest female characters in gaming. However, despite her fame, much of her philosophy has been misunderstood due to the puzzling manner in which the game presents her backstory and motives. This video will serve both as an examination of Kreia's philosophy and her criticisms of the Star Wars universe as a whole.

Chris Avellone famously said in an interview that Knights of the Old Republic 2 was meant to question everything there had to be questioned about Star Wars. This video will be answering those questions.

This video has been five months in the making.

"aU3zW0KDB5U","When to Attack a Moose","vlogbrothers","2018-05-06","2018-05-04","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aU3zW0KDB5U/hqdefault.jpg","I feel like this video could have easily been adapted into a medium-length non-fiction book. As soon as I start talking about identity, and story, and how we determine who we are, I basically can keep going forever. So I hope this wasn't too much, but also didn't leave so much out that it feels empty and vacuous and useless or, worse, dangerously simplistic.

Particularly simplified is the idea that ""caring what other people think about you"" prevents you from being ""really bad."" I don't actually know if that's true. But I think that caring what other people think about you is, like, maybe the only thing that gives society and culture enough cohesion to operate productively.

It has the potential to show a human being as they lived, long after their death. It’s the closest thing we have to immortality. However, we don’t think enough about who gets to live forever.

It’s not about awards. It’s not about quality, about prestige, about box office, or about how much a piece pushes the medium. Sometimes it’s just about who’s being shown. Whose story gets to be told. Because we’ll never know what we’ve already forgotten.

I'd like to give extra credit to Daniel Levitin in his book ""This is your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession"" for pointing me in the right direction.
Especially this passage from page 231-2:
""As the disease [Alzheimer's] progresses, memory loss becomes more profound.  Yet many of these old-timers can still remember how to sing the songs they heard when they were fourteen.  Why fourteen?  Part of the reason we remembers songs from our teenage years is because those years were times of self-discovery, and as a consequence, they were emotionally charged; in general, we tend to remember things that have an emotional component because our amygdala and neurotransmitters act in concert to ""tag"" the memories as something important.  Part of the reason also has to do with neural maturation and pruning; it is around fourteen that the wiring of our musical brains is approaching adultlike levels of completion.""

Colonialism is historically the policy of a nation hoping to extend its authority into other territories and over the people of other territories. In effect, the aim is the exploit the new territory for wealth, power, wealth and even wealth. To the colonizer, people are exploitable resources too. They can be taxed without being represented. They can be enslaved. They can be also be outright killed if they consume or occupy too much of the resources – like land – that the colonizing power wants for itself."

The phrase means different things to different people. Trying to summarise it succinctly is no doubt going to exclude the psychological angle, or the socio-political angle, or is going to be far too shallow for linguists.

It’s one of those subjects that can involve experts from very different fields who all see it through different prisms.

We're all familiar with puzzle games, but not many people have noticed that two distinct groups have emerged within this very broad genre. Even fewer have realised that this split is all about the power of authorial intent.

The Architect, being equally bad at both kinds of game, is well placed to tell you all about what makes a puzzle different from a problem, and how you can tell the difference.

Playing Pyre over Christmas got me thinking about feedback loops: the reward structures in games that can reinforce or balance out winners and losers. In this episode I’ll explain what this all means, and talk about the design of Pyre’s positive and negative loops.

At their core, George Lucas's six Star Wars films are coming of age stories about boys becoming men. Both Luke and Anakin Skywalker are guided and shaped by the principles of the Jedi Order but buried within Jedi teachings we find some troubling and deeply unhealthy ideas about masculinity.

The Book of Henry is pretty close to an ideal awful movie. There's dimensions to watching the film that I can't convey fully in a condensed video, like how stop-start the plots are, how Henry gets sick and the movie basically stops what it was doing for twenty minutes waiting for him to die, and how watching the film is to go through a rolling process of trying to figure out what the film is trying to actually tell you. People who are familiar with Jurassic World should catch the similar ways that Book of Henry demonizes a woman for not behaving exactly and precisely as the mother figure that the filmmakers think she should be. Susan gets off light, though, since she isn't executed by dinosaur for the crime of texting.

Far Cry has had a wild ride from sci-fi shooter to bland open world series, so let's talk about how Ubisoft go there series there, with towers, unused design from Far Cry 2, where Primal failed and the handling of story and setting.

A designer’s job often involves making sure players are experiencing the game in the most fun or interesting way. In this video, I look at examples of games that have tried to achieve this - sometimes with success, and sometimes with controversy.

Note: Those World of Warcraft numbers are completely made up, for illustrative purposes.

What is a neck lift? Why is it important in films? Simply put
It's a movie trope frequently used to demonstrate Super Strength,
often applied to make one character appear helpless or outmatched compared to another. It's used A LOT in comic book and fantasy movies.

Facebook ►https://www.facebook.com/HyperDriveUK1/

So why is this important? Well, unfortunately, it has been MISUSED
to compensate for bad writing or to fill in for action scenes in PG 13s Which leads me to a term I've coined called the ""Protagonist throw"" What is that you ask? It's a neck lift combined with a throw

Check my channel out for monthly Netflix movies, genre suggestions, science fiction, science fantasy content. Channel Hyperdrive describes some of the problems with action movie filmmaking today and provides some possible solutions to fix them.I mean there are a lot super funny Indian action movies out there that put a lot of Hollywood stuff to shame.

 During the process of film making during action & adventure movies are computer-generated visual effects really ruining movies? I'm not too sure but if they're done poorly the CG looks bad and will cause problems.

Blip.tv also positioned itself as ""just pals"" but that idea of ""we'll let the users guide our growth"" was a paper mask hiding a lack of core vision. They would make a lot of promises and did a lot of posturing vis a vis supporting creators and helping them develop content, but in the end Blip's business model was ""get bought by someone bigger."" That kind of worked out for them as they were bought by Maker Studios who were, themselves, in the business of getting themselves bought by someone bigger. So Maker buys Blip so Disney will buy Maker, opens Maker.tv as a hypothetical curated database clone-and-re-skin of Blip, but closes the whole thing within 18 months without ever actually re-launching the Blip creators they went out of their way to retain in the merger. As it turned out they had no real interest in developing content when they could just skim ad revenue off the 50,000 channels that fell below payment thresholds, and withhold payment en masse in order to milk the interest on the payroll account.

The Big Bang Theory provides a perfect lens through which to deconstruct a popular media trope I like to call the Adorkable Misogynist. Adorkable Misogynists are male characters whose geeky version of masculinity is framed as comically pathetic yet still endearing. Their status as nerdy “nice guys” then lets them off the hook for a wide range of creepy, entitled, and sexist behaviors.

This is the 1st of two video essays about gender on The Big Bang Theory. Next month I'll focus on how the show relentlessly mocks its four male leads for not acting like “real men,"" and in so doing reinforces a whole bunch of regressive ideas about masculinity.

• Yes, The Big Bang Theory was the most watched scripted TV show in 2016 according to Nielsen: http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/tops-of-2016-tv.html

"EFkIG5do34I","What I've Been Thinking About","vlogbrothers","2017-08-18","2017-08-18","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EFkIG5do34I/hqdefault.jpg","Race is uncomfortable for me to talk about, and I often have the impulse to, like, stay in my lane, to just amplify voices that are more credible than mine as a white man who knows nothing about racism except for the times when I discover my own bias.

But I have been encouraged by Black friends and Black Nerdfighters to talk more about this stuff because, like, I'm an American too. Watching the situation in Charlottesville unfold was a horror, and it's been terribly present in my mind ever since. America has a shameful history, but we also have a history of progress, and that continues now as we fight against a new wave of hate that has found new life.

I also want to be clear that having racist thoughts does not make you a Nazi. We all have bias, we all have fear, and sometimes we even have hate. It's what we do with those things that matters. Do we give in to irrational bias...or do we work hard to keep the hate from creeping in.

Here are some other great and important things I've read this week:

I won't say you're like a Michael Goi
I know your mind is made up so put away that get-up
I told you once I won't tell you again it's a mad shade

Lyrics:
Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Five hundred years like Gelignite
Have blown us all to hell
What savior rests while on his cross we die
While forgotten freedom burns
Has the Shepard led his lambs astray
To the bigot and the gun
Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies
I watch and stare as Rosin's eyes
Turn a darker shade of red
And the bullet with this sniper lie
In their bloody gutless cell
Must we starve on crumbs from long ago
Through bars these men made steel
Is it a great or little thing we fought
Knelt the conscience blessed to kill
Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies
Ah, but maybe it's the way you were taught
Or maybe it's the way we fought
But a smile never grins without tears to begin
For each kiss is a cry we all lost
Though there is nothing left to gain
But for the banshee that stole the grave
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies
I sit in and dwell on faces past
Like memories seem to fade
No color left but black and white
And soon will all turn grey
But may these shadows rise to walk again
With lessons truly learnt
When the blossom flowers in each our hearts
Shall beat a new found flame
Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies, singin' drunken lullabies

-----------LYRICS---------------

V1:
I stole your keys 'cos you stole my heart
It seems like a fair trade to me
Now i will drive around in your car
It helps me to feel free

I drive over bridges and rivers
being this far from you gives me shivers
I want to get away
but the flash on the fuel tank says I'm likely to stay

CH:
I awake you're not there I get to wondering
Where have you got to while I was a slumbering
Look around you're not there and all my keys are gone
Why would you take them when you know that it is wrong?

But then I see your wallet next to your heart next to mine.

V2:
Some think that this must be Freudian
Leaving my wallet behind
But girl you know I'm forgetful
Things often slip out of my mind

There was the time that I left the bath running
And flooded the room down the stairs
This is just one of the many examples
I use to prove to myself I really don't care

CH
I awake you're not there I get to wondering
Where have you got to while I was a slumbering
Look around you're not there and all my keys are gone
Why would you take them when you know that it is wrong?

But then I see your wallet next to your heart next to mine.

WHAT IS WEEBL's STUFF?

LYRICS
Hey everybody, everybody in the club tonight
I'm gonna talk a little bit in an exotic accent everybody,
Can't really tell where it's from, everybody
For the dance music y'all
Here's the black guy (Yeah. Bling Bling!)

Paid thirty dollars to get into this place
Can't even see your hand in front of your face
Shoulder to shoulder with a bunch of sweaty guys
Push on through them when we catch her eye

You say I like you (What?)
You say I want you (What?)
But she can't hear you (What?)
So she ignores you (What?)

And the the bass drops out because the chorus is near
Oh we don't need no rhymes and we don't write no words

So we say Yo, Yo
And you say Yo, Yo

And then the build up starts to the same bit from before
But with the bass back in so you can dance some more
And it gets higher and louder, and higher and louder, and higher and louder
Till the chorus comes in....

But this bit always tricks you

Yo, Yo
Yo, Yo

See it's easy to remember and it's easy to learn
That's why people call it catchy when they mean that it's terrible
The chorus has no words, we only singing Yo
It's not even English, sing along, here we go

So we sing Yo, Yo
And you sing Yo, Yo
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Took half an hour just to get to the bar
That fifty dollars didn't go very far
Some drunken douche-bag knocks your drink to the ground
You spent an hour trying to buy this round
Your roommate texts you, he's not here anymore
He needs the place tonight, he's gone home to score
Trapped in this sauna and there's smoke in your eyes
Try to convince yourself that you've had a good time

So you sing Yo, Yo
And we sing Yo, Yo

We sing it over & over & over & over & over & over
& over & over & over & over & over & over & over & over
And now they're playing Dubstep!

Yo, Yo
Yo, Yo

Everybody in club come on and let me hear you say Whoa (Whoa)
All the ladies in club whose feet really hurt say Oww (Oww!)
If you're sitting in the corner cos you drank too much say Blurgh (Blurgh!)
If you snuck into the club cuz you're 17 say nothing (...)
You know the word

Yo, Yo
Yeah dancing
Yo, Yo
Whoa it's nearly midnight
Yo, Yo

All right that's it the club's closed. Everybody out!

Lyrics:
Ah, icky thump
Who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well
What a chump
Well my head got a bump
When I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita
Looking dead
Came and said
Need a bed
In Español
I said
Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar
And I don't need a microphone

Icky Thump
With a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat
And I was freaking
I was ready to go!
And I swear
Besides the hair
She had one white eye
One blank stare
Looking up
Lying there
On the stand
Near her hand
Was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane
Dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

White Americans, what
Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out
You're an immigrant too
Who's using who
What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too
Icky thump
Handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind
Looked around
And there was nobody else
Left alone
I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how
To clean up after myself

We bring you the wilder side of gold and glitz

Run, neon tiger, there's a lot on your mind
They promised just to pet you, but don't you let them get you
Away, away, away
Under the heat of the southwest sun

You took to the spotlight like a diamond ring
You came from the woodwork in the hopes they might
Redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big

Run, neon tiger, there's a lot on your mind
They'll strategize and name you, but don't you let them tame you
You're far too pure and bold
To suffer the strain of the hangman's hold

I don't wanna be kept, I don't wanna be caged, I don't wanna be damned, oh hell
I don't wanna be broke, I don't wanna be saved, I don't wanna be S.O.L.
Give me rolling hills, so tonight can be the night that I stand among a thousand thrills
Mister, cut me some slack, 'cause I don't wanna go back, I want a new day and age
Come on girls and boys, everyone make some noise!

Run, neon tiger, there's a price on your head
They'll hunt you down and gut you, I'll never let them touch you
Away, away, away
I'm begging you neon tiger, run

Under the heat of
Under the heat of
Under the heat of the southwest sun

Neon Tiger
There's a lot on your mind"

""Stadium Love"" Lyrics :::

[Verse 1]
Wanna make a bet?
We'll be neck to neck
Taking off the gloves
Spider versus bat
Tiger versus rat
Rabbit versus dove

[Verse 2]
Wanna make a bet?
Odds are neck to neck
Taking off the gloves
Spider versus bat
Tiger versus rat
Owl versus dove

[Pre-Chorus]
Every living thing pushed into the ring
Fight it out to wow the crowd
Guess you thought you could just watch
No one's getting out

[Hook]
Without stadium love
Without stadium love

[Verse 3]
Wanna make a trade?
Cougar for a snake
Wanna fall in love?
Wanna make a deal?
Angel versus eel
Owl versus dove

[Pre-Chorus]
Every living thing pushed into the ring
Fight it out to wow the crowd
Guess you thought you could just watch
No one's getting out

[Hook]
Without stadium love
Without stadium love

We've got stadium love
We've got stadium love
We've got stadium love
We've got stadium love

[Outro]
Stadium love, love, love, love
Stadium love, love, love, love

Lyrics:

A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Getting good at starting over
Every time that I return

I'm learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learning to talk again
Cant' you see I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?

Do you remember the day
We built these paper mountains
And sat and watched them burn
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growing stronger
Little conquerors

I'm learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learning to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Now

For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free again
You keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice but knowing to survive
The first to find another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign
Forever, whenever
I never wanna die
I never wanna die
I never wanna die
I'm on my knees
Never wanna die
I'm Dancing on my grave
I'm Running through the fire
Forever, whenever
Never wanna die
Never wanna leave
Never say goodbye
Forever, whenever
Forever, whenever

I'm learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?

I'm learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
I'm learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough

The new music video from OK Go, made in partnership with Chevrolet. OK Go set up over 1000 instruments over two miles of desert outside Los Angeles. A Chevy Sonic was outfitted with retractable pneumatic arms designed to play the instruments, and the band recorded this version of Needing/Getting, singing as they played the instrument array with the car. The video took 4 months of preparation and 4 days of shooting and recording. There are no ringers or stand-ins; Damian took stunt driving lessons. Each piano had the lowest octaves tuned to the same note so that they'd play the right note no matter where they were struck. Many thanks to Chevy for believing in and supporting such an insane and ambitious project, and to Gretsch for providing the guitars and amps.

Opening up the difficult moral problem of charity, particularly in respect to beggars and panhandlers on the subway. This is right in your face in NYC, so I'm forced to think about it all the time. That moment when everyone looks at their feet is so revealing and pathetic. Closing your eyes and hoping it goes away is not something only kids do.

"ZHmivGmkjJw","The Stanley Parable, Dark Souls, and Intended Play","Folding Ideas","2017-07-27","2017-07-27","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZHmivGmkjJw/hqdefault.jpg","Clickbait title: Watch These Hot Games Intentionally Misbehave

The cough hasn't gotten any better. If anything it's worse now. I had to stop and hack a good, rumbling cough for a solid few seconds every other line. I wouldn't be surprised if it shows in the performance. The other thing, and this is petty I know, is that I'm dreading the inevitable wave of single commenters pointing out that my shirt is missing a button. They'll probably mostly assume that I missed a button, maybe make a crack about how I forgot how to dress myself, but, no, the shirt is just missing a button. I actually meant to take the spare from the fringe and repair the shirt before filming, but between the cough and the three hours of sleep it pretty much slipped my mind until recording was already done. Anyway, The Stanley Parable and Dark Souls are both really good games with very different approaches to narrative, you should check them out.

A juxtaposition of the Zulf's Theme (Mother, I'm Here) and Zia's Theme (Build That Wall, with some omissions) set to a grandiose score. This is the song that is played in the credits, regardless of which ending you choose.

Lyrics:

Zia's Part: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cELTdtw6U

Lie on my back
clouds are making way for me
I'm coming home, sweet home

Build that wall and build it strong cause
We'll be there before too long

I dig my hole you build a wall
I dig my hole you build a wall
One day that wall is gonna fall

Gon' build that wall up to the sky
Gon' build that wall up to the sky
One day your bird is gonna fly

Build that wall and build it strong cause
We'll be there before too long

Zulf's Part: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlfUcnSbKDA

I set my sail
fly the wind it will take me
back to my home, sweet home

Lie on my back
clouds are making way for me
I'm coming home, sweet home

I see your star you left it burning for me
Mother, I'm here

Eyes open wide
feel your heart and it's glowing
I'm welcome home, sweet home

I take your hand
now you'll never be lonely
not when I'm home, sweet home

I see your star, you left it burning for me
Mother, I'm here

Hey brotha what you thinkin'
Leave that old record spinnin’
You feel the rhythm going
Legs ain't got time to lay low
Your knees are bending so
It's time to get up and let go


Hey Mama, how is it going ?
Can’t see your body movin
Don’t leave the party dyin’
Keep booty shaking you know
Your head has no right to say ""no""
Tonight it’s ""ready, set, go!""

Baby can you move around the rhythm, so we can get with em,
Jump around, and get us a rock’n roll round
Whats the count down, body body,
Comin with a super hotty
Let’s go, real slow, hell no…

Baby can you move around the rhythm
cause you know we’re livin in the fast lane,
Speed up it ain’t no game
Just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene

Hey Brotha what you thinkin'
That good ol’ sound is ringin
They don’t know what they’re missin’
Legs ain't got time to lay low
Your knees are bending so
It's time to get up and let go
Hey Brotha nice and steady
Put down your drink, you’re ready
It’s hot when things get messy
Keep booty shaking you know
Your head has no right to say ""no""
Tonight it’s ""ready, set, go!""

Baby can you move around the rhythm
cause you know we’re livin in the fast lane,
Speed up it ain’t no game
Just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene

The Wilson family had always had an affinity for animals. Ever since little Dan (or Don) Wilson's first trip to the old petting zoo - however marred with tragedy it may have been - he had felt a kinship with all beasts. After recovering from grievous stomping injuries, little Dan began work on his first snare. Sure, it may have caught more children than animals, and most of them were himself, but it was the Plymouth Rock upon which he would inevitably land the Titanic of his greater vision for all animal kind. Several decades and a myriad of narrowly avoided lawsuits later, Iowa had its first well established animal sanctuary, rife with the creatures of the wild that needed Dan (or Don)'s protection from the encroachment of civilization. All of Iowa's native fauna were there: lions, giraffes, alpine ibexes and also a well oiled immigrant worker Dan had found at a little underpass bar called the Manhole. But no matter how many animals Dan (or Don) could save, there always existed the lingering knowledge that the world would not survive without him. One day, however, in the deepest, manholiest store in Iowa, he found it: Dog Sitter. Sweet memories of that first stampede at the petting zoo came rushing back to him. Blood swelled and filled various regions of his body, and he felt renewed purpose. This would be his new first step. Soon, Iowa's largest wildlife preserve would be expanding. Next: Wisconsin. After that, the World!"

When Willem first saw the corpse of the unknowable god being prodded by a young child with a stick, he discovered a plan formulating within him. After several hours of setting off firecrackers in its asshole, that plan was complete. After several more hours of stuffing frogs into Kos' mouth, that plan was... it was laid in Willem's mind. It would only take several more days of throwing m-80s at the body of she that fell from the heavens before that plan would begin. And that plan was to cut out peoples' eyes and shove them up their noses. That's probably the best way to get them to the brain. That way those eyes would open, and humans would at last be able to see something or another. Probably. Strangely, the first volunteers began to go insane. Huh. After a few more rounds of shooting roman candles into Kos' four week old corpse, Willem and his disciple, Laurence, had a schism of philosophy. Willem, who wished to continue carving out eyes and putting them in holes, and Laurence, who wished to keep fucking with Kos' corpse. The division was never reconciled, the corpse of Kos was abandoned, and the local fireworks factory went out of business. Such was the destiny of Yharnam, and the beginning of the end."

Long ago, during the Age of Ancients, the Dragons ruled a boring, one dimensional setting. The Dragon version of Tolkien was said to have once put to pen the idea of a tree that was sort of a brownish gray, instead of just gray. He was immediately executed for his dangerous, heretical ideas. It would take the four Lord Souls - weird spirit things that some naked zombies found in a fire - to put an end to this era of stupidity. The Souls transformed these naked, on-fire zombies into naked, on-fire humans that would quickly learn just how on-fire they truly were.

The Furtive Pygmy was the least popular of all the four Lords. He was slammed against many lockers, and was totally turned down by the Witch of Izalith when he asked her to prom. But the Pygmy understood how to play the long con, and set a dark plan in motion: to have sex with countless numbers of zombies. Like, thousands of them. No butterface was too stank for the Furtive Dick, in those days. From this long period of weird, secret corpse fucking, there arose all of humanity.

All humans today are descendents of a single corpse fucker. The gods - descendents of the other three Lords - were totally freaked out by this. From their big ass ancient city, they would rule over this sea of incestuous corpse fucking murder-happy pedophile weirdos, who also were all midgets. This would later be known as the glorious Age of Fire. Eventually, the gods would leave the capital of this age of horrifying sexual frenzy. Human historians would be totally confused as to why.

And so was set, the stage for the possible beginning of a new, Dark Age. Where supposedly it'll still be corpse fucking, but without light? I guess? Set forth, noble sex weirdo, to claim your birthright and fulfill the dark wishes of the Furtive Pygmy. It'll be rad. Probably."

Lyrics:

Strong together, united forever
They're the best of friends

But when troubles about, you'd best watch out
For the Watchmen!

Nite Owl is their leader
And he loves to party down

Rorschach's friends to the animals...

""Yeah, when he's not clowning around""

""I'm nutty!""

Beat up some thugs, say no to drugs
Be in bed by 10

But if troubles about, you'd best watch out
For the Watchmen!

Silk Spectres a sensation
You should really never miss

The Comedian's her biggest fan now...

""If I could only get that kiss!""

Ozy and Bubastis - a couple o'
Crimesolving superstars

Jon can give you cancer
and he'll turn into a car


Strong together, united forever
Come and meet your friends

Have no fear, times up, times here
For the Watchmen!

WATCH OUT!"

In the confines of a London dinner party, comedian Tim Minchin argues with a hippy named Storm. While Storm herself may not be converted, audiences from London to LA have been won over by Tim's wordplay and the timely message of the film in a society where science and reason are portrayed as the enemy of belief.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGne-ZUZCg0
And honestly, looking back at this video, I really regret not giving him a shoutout at the very least.
I made this video back when I was tiny and I never thought I'd go anywhere on YouTube, so when I saw bigger channels talking about concepts I was familiar with, I never thought that one day our videos might have any kind of overlap.
And in a way, even though I specifically remember my professor telling me to ""not bother with something that isn't in English or that you'll have to translate because of these problems,"" I look back on this video and feel bad that I didn't include PlayTheMind's video in at least some capacity.

""An Aesthetic of Ambiguity: Musical Representation of Indigenous Peoples in Disney's Brother Bear"" by Janice Esther Tulk
I only found this source after going through my music library after going to grad school, well after I'd made this video.  Had I had access to it while making this video I naturally would have cited it because it's such an amazing source on the production for this film.
Sorry to Ian Janice Esther Tulk, and I wish finding academic sources while outside of academia was easier and not behind a paywall

NOTE:
So it looks like I didn't convey what I meant with the ""Deilig er Jorden/Fairest Lord Jesus"" very well.
""Deilig er Jorden"" does not directly translate to ""Fairest Lord Jesus.""
BUT, if you look these two hymns up you'll find that they are the same piece of music.
This is a perfect example of how you have to change the meaning of a text when translating it into another language if you want to maintain the integrity of the piece in question.
Sorry for all of the confusion!"

When we talk about good AI, we often think about highly efficient and aggressive enemies in shooters like FEAR and Halo. But surely there's more to good artificial intelligence than this?

The rise of games inspired by Dark Souls has led some to suggest that Dark Souls invented a whole new genre of games. In this video, lets look at the ramifications of turning a game into a genre.

Paaaaart Two of my Avatar review! I didn't hate this movie. I just didn't really like it a lot. I think James Cameron is a great filmmaker and I've liked a lot of his movies, but this one was just a little too simplistic plot wise. It worked with Titanic for some reason, but this one not so much? Good times though..."

It looks at the games in terms of design, character development, and plot. It also tries to put a finger on what's special about the Mass Effect experience and why it's so beloved. This takes a long time to do-- don't think I made the video thinking you'd sit there listening to me for two and half hours. It's like an audio book-- choose a chapter and watch as much or as little as you like. It's also got major spoilers for all of everything Mass Effect, but if you haven't played the games by now, maybe spoilers is what you'd need to change your mind about it.

Why wasn't Donald Trump's blatant and unashamed misogyny a deal breaker for voters? I argue it has a lot to do with the ways pop culture, especially television sitcoms, work to normalizes sexist behavior.

There's something cathartic about drilling all the way down to the fundamentals. Not just the basic techniques, but the actual fundamentals, the bedrock of how something even functions in the first place, the reason why a series of edits can be used to tell a story rather than simply turning into abstract mush. It's also surprisingly challenging, like explaining what hands are.

My friend Lindsay recently did a video on this subject looking at Mad Max: Fury Road talking about this same subject (though she uses the term 'planting and payoff'; both are equally valid, though I'll admit that 'planting and payoff' has a wonderful alliterative quality to it versus 'setup and payoff') and I'll admit that I was a bit chapped, like I'd been beaten to the punch on a great idea. But that's the thing: not only was it a great idea it was also an obvious one. Anyone with a trained eye came away from Fury Road blown away by the almost perfect efficiency of the story in managing the establishment and use of every single prop, from the guns planted around the war rig to the steering wheel to the bolt cutters to the boot and the blood and the bullets.

Suicide Squad's construction is bad in a way that's legitimately unsettling for a movie of this scope and budget. There's serious concerns about what Warner Brothers is up to with how the DC films are being handled in general that makes you wonder if they aren't going to implode entirely.

While meta-discussion of YouTube is hardly lacking, I think there's a lot of room for more serious analysis of YouTube as a broad subject and all the myriad subcultures in specific. Every time I've attended VidCon I've been as surprised by the subcultures that are represented as I have by the ones that are absent. I think it would be utterly fascinating to see an ASMR panel at VidCon 2018, to hear a bunch of ASMR creators talk shop about the specific nuances of their genre, the common needs and wants of their audience, what makes a successful channel, and how the genre is evolving. The other day I saw a five hour long, multi-part ASMR choose your own adventure. you always think you have a handle on what's out there, until you realize you really don't.

Thanks to youtube.com/passthepi for giving me this game.

Faerie Solitaire is a casual game made by an independent studio Subsoap. Faerie Solitaire features a full adventure mode with a story, characters, upgrades, and collectible pets. There are 3 difficulty levels in Faerie Solitaire, with the hardest being extremely difficult to achieve without upgrades. Faerie Solitaire has quests for each level, and a fully fleshed out world. And to be honest, the core card game behind Faerie Solitaire is pretty fun. Faerie Solitaire was also named The Wall Street Journal's most addicting game, or something, and hey, they know what they're talking about right? I mean, shit, they control the stock prices. What would I know? They probably all went to grad schools like Harvard and Devry, and I'm just sittin' here playing Faerie Solitaire on Christmas.

"GJ2cSKBFBDQ","Errant Signal - Bioshock Infinite (Spoilers)","Errant Signal","2017-07-16","2013-04-09","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GJ2cSKBFBDQ/hqdefault.jpg","Bioshock Infinite is a game that recently came out and I played it.

Nothing I say here is all that original - most of what I had to say about the game was structural and design stuff, not lit crit stuff.  I may or may not do a video on that part of the game in the distant future, but for now I'm sort of Bioshock Infinite-d out.

It's certainly an odd duck - a game that (when it's hitting the right buttons) is impossible not to love, and there are moments and characters here that are simply inspired.  After I finished the game I couldn't stop thinking about it for days, and not just because of the ending - it was a game that had left some sort of emotional imprint on me.

And yet I had to force myself to keep playing in parts; to remind myself that there was a reason I wanted to finish a given combat section to see what good stuff waited on the other side.  And as I began a second playthrough that curiosity had diminished and I was left with an seething loathing for the bits that prevented me from getting to the parts I cared about.  At that point I realized that Bioshock Infinite is a charming two to three hour exploration adventure game padded out to seven to ten hours with some absolutely insufferable shooting mechanics that betray everything the *Shock series has ever been known for or good at.  To be clear: It's not a ""You changed it from what it used to be!"" thing.  It's more of a ""You took a series of interesting systems and turned them into a stock shooter - worse, a *terrible* stock shooter.  Feel bad about yourselves."""

The Warren Spector Master Series Episode 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=don-oWbjq3E

So let's talk about 0451! It's a number that shows up a bunch! For a reason, kind of, but also for no particular reason at all!  Because history!  Also spoilers for like a buttload of games.

So this was a tough one.  I wanted to do it after finishing Dishonored 2, then forgot that Prey was just around the corner.  Then I finished Prey and had to run off to Sweden which threw off production for a bit.  Then in the last days of writing the script I had a crisis of faith in the core idea but felt obligated to pull the trigger on it anyways.  A *lot* of rewriting went into this thing, and I'm still not certain it all comes together.  But hey, we have all summer's worth of videos to fix that!

It is also feature-length. Literally the length of numerous good films you could watch instead. Oops!

We also watch, in real time, as all my subscribers melt away and a dunce's hat descends from the heavens directly onto my balding head, and I start to go mad from the realisation that I'm still not sure whether to spell it Defense or Defence and words lose all meaning.

Today, we're going to talk about visual language, especially contrast and affinity, when it works and when it doesn't, and why the visual language of Transformers makes it so difficult for what actually *happens* in the movies to stick with you after you leave the theater.

Also I finally said something nice about Christopher Nolan!
