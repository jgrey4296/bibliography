*All rights to Bo Burnham*

Lyrics:

Hello patient 24602
I'm sorry- Hello, how are-
How are you feeling?
Um, not great
Has the treatment been working?
Uh, I don't think so, no
What are your remaining symptoms?
I just- I internalize my feelings a lot. I have trouble articulating how I'm feeling to other people. I feel like I just-
So basically you're still a little bitch
Yes, very mature of you disembodied voice way up there
I was just joking, nigga
All right, you're not as safe in Wisconsin as you might think with that shit
I'm not human I can say whatever I want
Okay, just let's get to the point. What's wrong with me, please? Please.

Your emotions and your logic are at war.
OK
Your creativity and your analysis are at war.
And most simply, your left and right brain are at war.
My left and my-
To fix the problem we must separate them from each other.
Sep-
Splitting your neurological functions in 5... 4...
(Can we book an appointment or something?)
3...
(You just don't start counting down to major medical procedures)
2... 1
This may hurt a bit
(I don't even know what 'it' is)
0
(Just tell me what you're-)
Isolation complete

This is Bo's left brain, objective, logical, cold, analytical
Aware of patterns, aware of trends, he's efficient, and a prick
This is Bo's right brain, subjective, creative, sensory
Aware of feelings, aware of people, he's emotional, and an idiot
(That's your opinion-just careful with opinions)
Okay, boys, play nice

I am the left brain, I am the left brain
I work really hard 'til my inevitable death brain
You got a job to do, you better do it right and the right way is with the left brain's might

I like oreos and pussy yah! (yes, in that order)
And I cried for at least an hour after watching ""Toy Story 3"" (Woody!)
'Cause I am the right brain, I have feelings,
I'm a little all over the place but I'm lustful, trustful and I'm looking for somebody to love... Or put my penis in

Here comes a female, here comes a female
Puff your chest. I'll take your phone out and check your email
Our evolutionary purpose is repopulate
So gather data now and see if she's a possible mate

Holy fuck I think she might be the one, there's something about her, I just can't describe it
Tits
I am the earth, she is the glorious sun
I want her to trust me and I just want her to- how do i say this- sit on my face!
(Sit! Sit on my face!)

Alright now right brain you're being insane
No left brain, I'm just being alive
You should try it, you might like it

I worked hard to give him everything he cared about
You were worried about the things that he was scared about
I'm calm and collected when you act wild
I am the adult, you are the child

You think you're the right one every time
You think you know everything but you don't know anything at all
Half of his problems were supposed to be mine
But you wanted everything.
I hope that you're happy 'cause he's sure not

Well, according to my calculations, I'm sorry, let me run the numbers again, um, you're a pussy

Name calling? Really? You're gonna just do name calling?

I'm not calling names alright, I'm just stating facts and the fact is you're a quivering pussy

I'm the pussy? Well, at least I don't play with toys still, OK...

Rubik's cubes are not toys, they keep my spacial reasoning skills... sharp

Left brain plays with toys!
Look at you, Mr... you're a toy player

Well at least I did my fucking job, alright. I kept him working, I kept him productive
You were supposed to look after him
You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this
Now you're trying to blame me for how he's feeling, how he's feeling!
If he's feeling unhappy it's because you failed him
You did this to him, he hates you I know he does, he fucking hates you!

Right brain, look, I'm sorry, okay?

No, you're not

Look, maybe there's something we could do together

Together?

Take the best parts of both of us and put them together

I'm listening

It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyze

So you could man the themes; I'll man the form.
It's something that George Carlin did, it's something that Steve Martin did
It's something special that we could both perform.
Do you know what it is?

Juggling, we could juggle, and juggle our cares away!

It was... It was comedy, you, fuck it, we could do comedy together.

(Initiate reassembly)

All right, right brain we're gonna do comedy together, we gotta do comedy together

All right, left brain I'll do comedy with you

Look, we can fix him like this- we can make him happy again. I promise, all right?

(5, 4, 3)

Left brain... left brain, I love you

(2)

ABOUT THE GOOD PLACE
From creator Michael Schur (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “Parks and Recreation” and “Master of None”) comes a unique comedy about what makes a good person. The show follows Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell, “House of Lies,” “Veronica Mars”), an ordinary woman who enters the afterlife, and thanks to some kind of error, is sent to the Good Place instead of the Bad Place (which is definitely where she belongs). While hiding in plain sight from Good Place Architect Michael (Ted Danson - “Cheers,” “CSI” - in an Emmy Award-nominated performance), she’s determined to shed her old way of living and earn her spot.

These are in no particular order, grouped by ""decade."" It does not contain any clips of Caroline.

""Hello friends, investors, test subjects. Fan of Cave Johnson here. And let me tell you, have I got something to share today. A couple days ago one of the test subjects found her way into the gates of hell. Couldn't stop her if we tried. Somewhere down there she tested and re-tested everything we thought was good and buried for ages. Apparently a solid multi-layered enormous hatch door can't keep everything out like the engineers said it would. So, Cave went ahead and fired their descendants. Didn't need 'em anyway.""

""We found these pre-recorded messages shortly after and here we are today. Now,all the tapes were covered in mold, asbestos, moon dust, repulsion gel, or some combination of otherwise highly dangerous and lethal substances that would kill anything that got within fifteen feet of it. But we had to get what we could! For science.""

""We ran out of employees to re-record the tapes and we got some more sitting around. When we get the funding, believe me, they will be heard again. We are also recruiting new test subjects for the same test. Average commitment is about seven minutes. And there's sixty bucks at the end of it. If you're interested, let a test associate know. Fan of Cave Johnson, we're done here."""

Game Description:

Earth is burning. Striking from beyond known space, a race of terrifying machines have begun their destruction of the human race. As Commander Shepard, an Alliance Marine, your only hope for saving mankind is to rally the civilizations of the galaxy and launch one final mission to take back the Earth.This item does not come with a gun or controller accessory.

Mass Effect 3 is a Role-playing Game (RPG) / Third-Person Shooter hybrid set in a Science Fiction universe. Mass Effect 3 is the third game in the popular Mass Effect series, and is rumored to be the final installment. In it players continue the adventures of Commander Shepard utilizing extreme character customization which is the hallmark feature of the series. Additional features include: the ability to import decisions from both of the previous games into the new game, ownership/play of previous games not required, customizable weapons, improved mobility and melee combat, many returning characters (if they were not killed off in previous imported games), an improved cover system that allows for more action, compatibility with the Kinect Sensor for Xbox 360 and more.

The Final Chapter in the Mass Effect Trilogy

Not everyone will survive. An ancient alien race, known only as ""Reapers,"" has launched an all-out invasion leaving nothing but a trail of destruction in their wake. Earth has been taken, the galaxy is on the verge of total annihilation, and you are the only one who can stop them. The price of failure is extinction. You are Commander Shepard, a character that you can forge in your own image. You determine how events will play out, which planets to explore, and whom to form alliances with as you rally a force to eliminate the Reaper threat once and for all. How you wage this war is completely up to you: go into combat with guns blazing or use cover to plan a more tactical assault. Utilize your squad to full effect or take a lone wolf approach. Rain death from a distance or go toe-to-toe with enemies using devastating melee attacks. Mass Effect 3 will react to each decision you make as you play through a truly unique experience of your own creation.

A Rich, Branching Storyline - Experience a sci-fi epic with multiple endings determined by your choices and actions throughout the game

Massive in Scope - Battle on many worlds across the galaxy as you unite the ultimate force to take back the Earth before it's too late

Large-scale and Intelligent Enemies - Battle enormous enemies and take on a smarter type of foe that will consistently challenge your best combat tactics and put you on the edge of your seat

Unlock a Customizable Arsenal - Tailor each weapon with devastating upgrades including scopes, grips, barrels and dozens of other unique attachments. Each weapon boasts its own powerful impact and visual flair

Unleash Death from Afar or Go Toe-to-Toe - Customize your soldier and squad to engage the enemy on your terms. A huge variety of weapons, abilities and equipment allow you to combat the enemy in your preferred style of play

Play with Kinect - Mass Effect 3 features compatibility with the Kinect Sensor for Xbox 360"

May, 18, 2009 : Super PSTW Action RPG is released by Rhete
February, 3, 2010 : Axman13 reviews Super PSTW
February, 4, 2010 : Dot Dot Dot (narration of Axman's review) by D-Mac-Double
January, 6, 2011 : Ricepirate animates Dot Dot Dot

In an age where the anonymous reviewer is held to no general standard of grammar or spelling, an intelligible trolling rant is a common and often eye-rolling occurrence.  And when a game is meant as a parody of its genre, and a player playing it doesn't quite get the joke ... well, magic happens.

But the real triumph, is when an epic voice actor decides to perform a run-of-the-mill game review rant ... committing to all its grammatical belligerence.

I present to you, Dot Dot Dot — Animated.  I hop uyo enjo it.

Written and Performed by Christiaan Van Vuuren (@ChristiaanVanV)
Recorded and Mixed by Damien Enemark at Song Zu.

LYRICS BELOW:

The woodpecker bird, likes pecking wood,
The Bluebird’s a bird, that sings pretty good.
Sparrows are a bird that are pretty cool, ay.
But the ibis is a bird that drinks bin-juice all day.

A crow is a bird with a really cool squawk,
A cockatoo’s a bird with a sick Mohawk,
The chicken is a bird that tastes good and lays eggs,
But Ibis’s, are bin-juice drinking dregs!

A goose is a bird that’s chilled like a duck.
An ibis is a bird that’s a picnic-wrecking fuck!
Doves are birds that represent purity.
Ibis’s wreck picnics and disrupt the community.

Penguins are birds that fall in love and mate for life,
BUT IBIS’S LOVE NOTHING CAUSE THEY’RE DEAD INSIDE!
A Swan is a bird that’s graceful and that.
And Ibis’s aren’t birds, they’re feathered bin-rats.

It's the ibis (ibis) bin-juice drinking gronk.
Yeah the ibis (ibis) they’re beaks are gross and long.
It's the ibis (ibis!) Picnic wrecking jerk.
It’s the ibis (ibis) they’re the worst bird.

The condor is an awesome bird of prey,
A hawk’s a bird that’s a cool bird ay.
The eagle bird soars through the sky as it hunts,
But ibis's are bin-juice drinking cunts.

The albatross bird lives to 60, maybe older.
A parrot is a bird living on a pirate’s shoulder,
Parrots say cool shit like ""polly wanna cracker"".
But Ibis’s just fucken come up and harass ya.

A lorikeet is a bird, with a colourful jacket.
Ibis’s can fuck off back to their home planet!
A seagull’s a bird that scabs hot chips, 
And there's only one bird that's scabbier than this -

It's the ibis (ibis) picnic wrecking irrits.
It’s the ibis (ibis) I hope they don’t come near us.
It's the ibis (ibis) Bin juice drinking jerks.
It’s the ibis (ibis) they’re the fucken shittest birds.

The ibis is a picnic wrecking, burden on humanity.
A dumpster diving, bin-chicken, disrupting the community,
Annoying the general public, at every opportunity.
Disgrace to feathered creatures, bringing shame on the bird family!

If there are any Ibis’s watching this, firstly - there’s no bin-juice here, so you can fuck off.
Secondly, get a job and fucken do something with your life. Sort it out, you’re on the road to nowhere…
Go migrate to that garbage island floating in the middle of the pacific ocean or some shit. I dunno. I’m not your Dad, I can’t tell you how to live your life, Just… Do something, and stop wrecking everyone’s picnics. Fuck.

It's the ibis (ibis) bin-juice drinking cunt!
It’s the ibis (ibis) that’s ruining your lunch!
It's the ibis (ibis) picnic-wrecking jerk!
It’s the ibis (ibis) what a cunt of a bird.
….. If I was an Ibis I’d go kill myself…."
