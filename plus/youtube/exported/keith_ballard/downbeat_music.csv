Lyrics:

It's been a long dark dirty road
And pocket full of gold
I've been out here now
All on my own
It's real quiet here
Just the way I like it here
There's no one to bother me
Except

In 1955, born into Wadena's pride
I laid my head on that
Milligan creek bed
When I was a young man
I helped build this land
Oh, I put down these rails as a
CPR man

Thought I'd live forever
With my heart in my pocket
Oh, my gun by my side
And my feelings in a locket

Well, that was a cold year in '77
But I married my wife
We had two kids
I gave her a daughter
She gave me a son
And we rode those damn horses 'til we had none

Fist still like flyin'
Doing things for dyin'
Oh, I should have put that old gun away

Well I, I am a broken Cowboy
And I don't feel right no more
'Cause I am a broken Cowboy

Livin' life in the fast lane
Racing cars and robbing trains
I thought I had it all
Then one day, I got the call
A father's worst dream
My son went down and I

The colours deceive me
As I see grey
Oh, you're cutting me down with those
Cold words you're saying
Then you called me, brother
But this can't be so, 'cause you
Slander my name, anywhere the wind will blow

Well, I am a broken cowboy
And I don't feel right no more
'Cause I am a broken cowboy
Yes, I am a broken cowboy

It's been a long dark dirty road
But a pocket full of gold
And I've been out here now
All on my own
Well, it's real quiet here
Just the way I like it here
There's no one to bother me
Except that old taunting tree

"g4UZRYShjYU","Hurt - Nine Inch Nails (Bardcore | Medieval Style Cover)","Hildegard von Blingin'","2023-11-27","2023-05-23","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g4UZRYShjYU/hqdefault.jpg","Greetings all! I'm back with another bardcore cover, which in some ways is a cover of a cover. Hurt was written by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, and famously covered by Johnny Cash only 7 months before his death. I'm throwing my hat in the ring with a somewhat unusual take on the theme, but had to stop myself from bawling while recording even with the altered lyrics. Some of the words resisted change of any kind. No matter the context, this song gets you right in the human frailty.

The art:
A heavily altered Miniature of Conrad III of Germany from Chronica Regia Coloniensis (Cologne Kings' Chronicle; Cologne; ca. 1240). Brussels, Biblioth√®que Royale, Ms. 467, fol. 64v

Lyrics:
I fell upon my sword
To see if I could die
I woke upon the morn,
And still I was alive
The arrow tears a hole,
The old familiar sting
The fates hold out my thread,
But cannot cut the string

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I love fades away in the end
And thou couldst have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let thee down
I will make thee hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
Thou art someone else
And I am still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I love fades away in the end
And thou couldst have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let thee down
I will make thee hurt
If I could start again
A thousand leagues away
I would keep my oath
I would find a way"

Bo Burnham was restricted to his room and created a show that was written, directed, produced, and performed by no one other than himself. Certain pieces of the special are quite funny, but the majority of his work is about the depression and mental illness caused by the weight of quarantine and isolation. His creativity is now on display in songs like this one in the 90-minute Netflix special ""Inside.""

I remember the first time I heard this song. I was fresh out of high school, driving with the windows down to my job at Jamba Juice from Waikiki beach. I could feel the sun on my skin from laying out - and I still smelt of salt water. I'm sure I was running late to work (sorry, Malia!). And then this song comes on the radio. I remember pulling over on the side of the street - I've never heard anything like it up to this point. And my initial response was bigger than ""I like this song"" or ""I don't like this song."" It was a feeling that took over, a sense of wonder and unfamiliarity.
Paul and I really wanted to change things up - because change is always a good thing. Dare to do something that you'd never think of doing. After receiving Ableton, I thought the best way to learn how the hell to use it was by doing a video. It helped - I love how Ableton gives you endless possibilities to create music. I hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed making it!

""Wishful Drinking"" Lyrics:

Separate me from the rest of the herd so
I can run away from all of‚ÄÖmy‚ÄÖhurt, oh
Drink what‚ÄÖI want
Be what I want
Say what‚ÄÖyou want me to say, like
I can pretend that I don't want to end I'm afraid
(I'm dangerous)

Weave a story so I don't have to talk, no
It's not a problem if I never get caught, oh
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say, like
I can pretend that I don't want to end I'm afraid
(I'm dangerous)

Oh, wishful drinking
Tell myself that I'm not thinking 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinking now
(Hey)
Wishful drinking
Go ahead and stop your thinking now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinking now
(Ahhh)

Hide your demons where no one can see 'em
Out of sight but in your mind you believe them
Drink what you want
Be what you want
Say what they want you to say, like
I can pretend that I don't want to end I'm afraid
(Ahhh)

Do you think, do you think that they notice?
I keep a bottle by my bed, it's the focus
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what they want you to say, like
I can pretend that I don't want to end I'm afraid
(I'm dangerous)

Oh, wishful drinking
Tell myself that I'm not thinking 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinking now
Wishful drinking
Go ahead and stop your thinking now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinking now

This is not a problem if I don't want it to stop
Can't call it a problem if I never let a plate drop
This is not a problem if convincing that it's not
Don't call it a problem, it's the only thing that I still got

Hey, oh, hey, oh no
Down, down, down,
Wishful drinking now

Oh, wishful drinking
Tell myself that I'm not thinking 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinking now
Wishful drinking
Go ahead and stop your thinking now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinking now

I've always loved the heavy blues influence in Jack White's guitar playing, and the original recording of ""Seven Nation Army"" is a killer hybrid of bluesy slide guitar and analog punk.  I wanted to take that all the way back down the Mississippi, and give it the full Delta Blues treatment.  The melody and bassline sound simple until you try playing them at the same time.

Lyrics:

And I could wait around just a little bit longer
I‚Äôll be gone by the time of the end of this song
There goes the ghost of a girl I adored
Oh Magdalene

Ok, I guess I‚Äôm a fool for hire
I know, I know I saw all the signs
It never is enough to be almost in love
And if we keep pretending then we‚Äôre wasting our lives
So keep the shirts I left at your place
They‚Äôll do nothing for me now except dress me in pain
I know, I know that love is a game
But if I keep losing, I don‚Äôt want to play

And I could wait around just a little bit longer
I‚Äôll be gone by the time of the end of this song
There goes the ghost of a girl I adored
Oh Magdalene

And I could wait around just playing my part
Laughing at the tattoos left on my heart
I‚Äôm no good at good, I‚Äôm no good at goodbye
Oh Magdalene, why even try

And I could wait around just a little bit longer
I‚Äôll be fine by the time of the end of this song
So long to the ghost of a girl I adored
Oh Magdalene

The Curse Lyrics:
And the people went into their hide, they oh
From the start they didn't know exactly why, why
Winter came and made it so all look alike, look alike
Underneath the grass would grow, aiming at the sky

It was swift, it was just, another wave of a miracle
But no one, nothing at all would go for the kill
If they called on every soul in the land, on the moon
Only then would they know a blessing in disguise

The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before

Tell me now of the very souls that look alike, look alike
Do you know the stranglehold covering their eyes?
If I call on every soul in the land, on the moon
Tell me if I'll ever know a blessing in disguise

The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before
And the curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before"

Lyrics:
Road trippin‚Äô with my two favorite allies
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It‚Äôs time to leave this town, it‚Äôs time to steal away
Let‚Äôs go get lost anywhere in the U.S.A
Let‚Äôs go get lost, let‚Äôs go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
Staying high and dry‚Äôs more trouble than it‚Äôs worth in the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory‚Äôs got our snakefinger on
Now let us drink the stars, it‚Äôs time to steal away
Let‚Äôs go get lost right here in the U.S.A
Let‚Äôs go get lost, let‚Äôs go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for

Lyrics:
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all
Over myself
To lick your heart
And taste your health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we
Call it fall
I'll make it to the moon
If I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Lyrics:
My friends are so depressed
I feel the question of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

Ex-girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate on a prison phone
They want to give her seven years
For being sad

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on the brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

Imagine me
Taught by tragedy
Release is peace

I heard a little girl
And what she said was something beautiful
To give your love no matter what
Was what she said

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

Lyrics:
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell,
Blue skys from pain.
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

And did they get you to trade
Your heros for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl,
Year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here."

Lyrics:

Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah...

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you toher kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Lyrics
Lorde- Royals

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
(Ooh ooh oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
