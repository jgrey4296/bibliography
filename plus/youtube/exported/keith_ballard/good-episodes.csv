The Eternal Cylinder is a game about a cylinder... that is eternal. And also it's about committing yourself fully to a queer found family, and playing the trumpet very loudly together to show that nothing can get you down. Well, except the Cylinder. And the Cylinder is ETERNAL.

Inscryption is a roguelite card battler from the maker of Pony Island, which is to say that it is definitely not just a roguelite card battler. It also simulates the greatest horror a card gamer can encounter: being stuck playing against an edgy weirdo who takes the game VERY seriously.

Rain World is a game about desperately trying to survive in a broken ecosystem, but at least you get to be an adorable slugcat while doing it! Can we find our way back to our nomadic family before we are consumed by giant terrifying monsters or swept away by torrential downpours? No, probably not. But we'll try anyway, because what else are we going to do?

Disco Elysium is a roleplaying game from developer ZA/UM about being maybe the worst detective. I mean, you could probably make a character who is a good detective, but I have not done that. Join me as we explore the city of Revachol, dig into a unique skill system and deep dialogue mechanics, try to regain control of our face, and hopefully manage to not get ourselves on the wrong side of any firearms.

Game Description:

Earth is burning. Striking from beyond known space, a race of terrifying machines have begun their destruction of the human race. As Commander Shepard, an Alliance Marine, your only hope for saving mankind is to rally the civilizations of the galaxy and launch one final mission to take back the Earth.This item does not come with a gun or controller accessory.

Mass Effect 3 is a Role-playing Game (RPG) / Third-Person Shooter hybrid set in a Science Fiction universe. Mass Effect 3 is the third game in the popular Mass Effect series, and is rumored to be the final installment. In it players continue the adventures of Commander Shepard utilizing extreme character customization which is the hallmark feature of the series. Additional features include: the ability to import decisions from both of the previous games into the new game, ownership/play of previous games not required, customizable weapons, improved mobility and melee combat, many returning characters (if they were not killed off in previous imported games), an improved cover system that allows for more action, compatibility with the Kinect Sensor for Xbox 360 and more.

The Final Chapter in the Mass Effect Trilogy

Not everyone will survive. An ancient alien race, known only as ""Reapers,"" has launched an all-out invasion leaving nothing but a trail of destruction in their wake. Earth has been taken, the galaxy is on the verge of total annihilation, and you are the only one who can stop them. The price of failure is extinction. You are Commander Shepard, a character that you can forge in your own image. You determine how events will play out, which planets to explore, and whom to form alliances with as you rally a force to eliminate the Reaper threat once and for all. How you wage this war is completely up to you: go into combat with guns blazing or use cover to plan a more tactical assault. Utilize your squad to full effect or take a lone wolf approach. Rain death from a distance or go toe-to-toe with enemies using devastating melee attacks. Mass Effect 3 will react to each decision you make as you play through a truly unique experience of your own creation.

A Rich, Branching Storyline - Experience a sci-fi epic with multiple endings determined by your choices and actions throughout the game

Massive in Scope - Battle on many worlds across the galaxy as you unite the ultimate force to take back the Earth before it's too late

Unleash Death from Afar or Go Toe-to-Toe - Customize your soldier and squad to engage the enemy on your terms. A huge variety of weapons, abilities and equipment allow you to combat the enemy in your preferred style of play

Play with Kinect - Mass Effect 3 features compatibility with the Kinect Sensor for Xbox 360"
