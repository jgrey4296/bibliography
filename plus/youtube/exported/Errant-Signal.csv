"YDQ24iAkh90","How System Shock's Reboot Wrestles With Adapting Its Legacy","Errant Signal","2023-10-02","2023-10-02","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YDQ24iAkh90/hqdefault.jpg","How much of a game's identity is tied up in its rough edges? What do you gain by smoothing those edges away? What do you lose?  System Shock (1994) and System Shock (2023) serve as a nice case study for this line of thought. While 1994's System Shock is a seminal work whose impact echoes through to today it's also a game a lot of people simply refuse to play given its archaic input systems and low-fi graphics.  Meanwhile, 2023's System Shock wants to bring the game to The People - but that means hammering a game that's full of awkward-but-interesting choices into something a bit more conventional.  Does that smooth out the game's problems, or erase its identity? Let's take a look!"
"Zz4uppst-7I","Children of Doom 1998: Half-Life","Errant Signal","2023-06-13","2023-06-13","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zz4uppst-7I/hqdefault.jpg","1998 sure did happen! And there were video games all up in it!  So let's talk about way too many of them!

It's weird to have watched this series change: what started as a time filler in between ""bigger"" essays has itself become one of the biggest projects in scope I've ever done.  And what started as talking about one game each year has slowly become more and more about looking about each year in context and cross-comparing what was going on.  I think this is more useful and interesting, but it is also undeniably more resource and time intensive to produce.  Hopefully the results continue to bear fruit, though.

The Outer Wilds is a game that is difficult to talk about, because it's a game about discovering itself.  Which means the more I talk about it, the more I take the game away from you.  And that's a difficult position to be in when this game makes me want to talk about it *so badly!*

Anyways I was halfway through a script that tried to navigated this issue by having a front half that was largely spoiler free and a back half that was spoiler city, and I realized it made the whole thing lumpy and awkward (and also required most people to drop off halfway through the video).  So I figured I'd cut it in half, release a spoiler free version (or as spoiler free as you can when talking about this game), and then next time we'll *really* dig in to what's going on here."

If you've followed this channel for any amount of time you know that I like small, weird, quirky games.  And there are so many out there!  And you would think that would mean we'd have coverage of small games for days, but... we don't.  And so I wanted to take some time to talk about why!

Here's the list of all the small games from the video! It's... long! Remember, these aren't really endorsements - there's a mishmash of stuff in here at various price points/levels of fidelity and polish/amount of stuff going on thematically, and not all of it is gonna resonate with everyone. But hopefully *some* of it will resonate with you. Check them out!

Hey all! This month we're looking at a small indie game that's sort of a hyper-stylized visual novel!  It's about being a Very Online Teenager in 1999, and also about a young trans woman coming to realize that fact. It's pretty neat if you like vaporwave music, chilling on the internet with some friends on rainy days, or young adult fiction!

So this was a tough one.  I wanted to do it after finishing Dishonored 2, then forgot that Prey was just around the corner.  Then I finished Prey and had to run off to Sweden which threw off production for a bit.  Then in the last days of writing the script I had a crisis of faith in the core idea but felt obligated to pull the trigger on it anyways.  A *lot* of rewriting went into this thing, and I'm still not certain it all comes together.  But hey, we have all summer's worth of videos to fix that!

It wants to tell a relatable coming of age story, and it wants to tell the story of Possum Springs.  But it does so in a way that has a lot of meat to dig into by relating the two.

So I tried to break down exactly why that is in what will probably be as close to a Christmas-y episode as this show can get.

It's tempting to suggest this is just fanboy whining - that I'm upset that this new Dead Rising isn't like the old Dead Rising.  But I really firmly believe that the new stuff is this awkward mix of stolen mechanics that do little to enhance the core Dead Rising game systems, and all the while the stuff that made Dead Rising... well, Dead Rising has been downplayed more and more with each sequel.

I mean, there are so many interesting places you could take a sequel.  You could lean into the Home Alone thing and put an emphasis on traps and defense more than active combat.  You could take the idea of objects with small sets of clearly defined rules and try to design them to interact and get more of an emergent-y thing going on.  You could keep the gameplay largely the same and double down on the culture commentary - it's probably overworn subject matter at this point, but it'd be *something* to call your own.

Instead we get... detective mode, stealth takedowns, towers to unlock, collectibles to snap pictures of.... ~shakes head~  I'm really curious as to whether the game that got shipped was a rushed title or if it really was the vision for the franchise by Capcom Vancouver, and the increasingly sad thing is I'd believe either.

This is a game about cleaning up junk on a spaceport with an incinerator device.  It's also a game about poverty!  So you know it's gonna be fun.

In all seriousness: Most of my videos end in an awkwardly cliche attempt to wrap up complex or interesting arguments with a hokey summarization, but this is one of those videos where I feel like the last bit holds up better than the arguments that precede it.  The game is definitely about poverty and it definitely has something to say about the sorts of stories games tell, but it's hardly a deep treatise on the nature of the working poor or the limitations of power fantasies.  Most of it really is just an empathy piece; a game about playing someone else's life for a while - not so much in a role playing sense, but in a systemic sense.  Call it a ludic character study.  And in that sense you *feel* how difficult it is to get by with jobs that barely pay you enough to live in a way that isn't preachy to its audience or condescending to its subject.

And that experience will probably put off a lot of people, but I found  the experience really edifying.  And it probably helps that it all takes place in an adorable abstract spaceport with some cool looking aliens to boot.

This episode took a lot of doin'. FRAPS started causing the game to halt for seconds at a time (resulting in useless footage) so I switched over to Bandicam.  Unfortunately that meant that the footage was compressed, which makes sliding around in an editor looking for just the right clip to use super laggy.  This was exacerbated by the game being 25 hours long and an open world that tells its story in somewhat sporadic chunks.  So yeah, editing this thing was a bit of a beast.  I hope you enjoy it!

I'm hoping this won't be too contentious; I'm fully willing to concede that estimating game lengths is kind of arbitrary and hard.  What does it mean, *really*, to estimate the length of a Fallout game?  Are we talking a completionist playthrough?  The main story line alone? The ""average"" playthrough?  What does it mean to estimate the length of a round of TF2?  Should we measure by expected session length instead of time-to-win/loss?  These are all super complicated questions, but my frustration isn't that we don't have answers but that we're not even really asking them.  I think How Long to Beat has a good rubric to start from, but even that's got some built in assumptions - it doesn't work as well for multiplayer games, for example.  Maybe we can talk about what it means to measure the length of a game in the comments?

It should also be noted that the slump I'm experiencing in Mafia 3 is by no means unique to the game.  Shadow of Mordor had it.  Mad Max had it.  Heck, for people that aren't all that interested in emergent chaos FarCry 2 had it.  Lots of open world games that ask you to repeat the same behaviors over and over again as you traverse the space kind of fall into this issue; it seems to be an open world design caveat in general.  And like Mafia 3, FarCry 2, Mad Max, and Shadow of Mordor were all super fun!  They just... kinda sagged in the middle.  It's a pacing issue, not one of quality.  Ah well, open world design thoughts for another day.  I'm actually trying to figure out why Burnout Paradise doesn't suffer from this so much, and I think it's because you can switch between play modes dynamically? ""Eh, I'm done racing, let's do some car combat. Eh, I'm done with car combat, let's do some exploration.  Eh, I'm done with exploration, let's do some stunt runs.""  Mafia 3 doesn't have nearly this level of flexibility - I find myself jumping between ""stealth/combat"" and ""exploration"" and that's about it.

Regardless, expect a more general, thematic look at Mafia 3 in the not too distant future.  And then something else entirely!

Alien Isolation: A game that's... scary?  Tense?  Not sure how to end itself?  An attempt to adapt a 70's scifi horror property into a retrofuturistic videogame?

So with Unrest I basically wanted to talk about its interesting approach to world building; how it approaches the world holistically in a way that makes the city the real character you're examining.  And I also wanted to talk about the realities of low-budget Kickstarter games, and whether it's fair to expect them to reflect the same feature set games with literally orders of magnitude more money have on hand.

Then I realized both topics are probably beyond the scope of a 6 minute video.  So, uh.  Oops.

This is, perhaps, the most Angry Videogame Reviewer-y, snarky thing I've done in a while.  I suppose it's healthy to get it out of my system, though.  And honestly few games have earned my ire more this year.

I know that some people will argue that Aiden ostensibly has the option of solving some problems by brutal beatings and not *necessarily* murder, but I think that sort of underscores the point I'm making: on his best days Aiden is a guy who pummels people into submission with a club because his phone said to.  On his worst days he'll shoot purse snatchers in the back as they run away.  But yeah, sure, I'm sure he's a great uncle and everyone should look up to him and he's the next Batman or whatever.  Good job, Ubisoft.

I also didn't find an opportunity to talk about the game's sex trafficking scenes, which sort of sucks because they're *wildly* inappropriate.  I mean, I get that Aiden tries to stop the sex trafficking, but look at how they're framed.  It's ~2 missions completely irrelevant to the rest of the plot that exists more or less for the express purpose of ""check out these boobs.""  It's completely irrelevant to the main narrative and feels like either a holdover from a bigger side story (see also: Defalt and Pawnee) or it's a crass attempt to meet the ""brothel level"" quota that videogames seem to have these days.  Yuck.

Oh, also, I'm turning comments off as part of an experiment to see if it makes the internet a less awful place.  We'll see.  If comments must be made, try in our kinda-almost-new subreddit:

Also, I'm pretty sure my video card is dying - I don't think those are rendering glitches in the game, I think it is literally my hardware and/or drivers deciding for a few frames that certain sprites need to be rendered in absolutely the wrong way.

Nothing I say here is all that original - most of what I had to say about the game was structural and design stuff, not lit crit stuff.  I may or may not do a video on that part of the game in the distant future, but for now I'm sort of Bioshock Infinite-d out.

It's certainly an odd duck - a game that (when it's hitting the right buttons) is impossible not to love, and there are moments and characters here that are simply inspired.  After I finished the game I couldn't stop thinking about it for days, and not just because of the ending - it was a game that had left some sort of emotional imprint on me.

And yet I had to force myself to keep playing in parts; to remind myself that there was a reason I wanted to finish a given combat section to see what good stuff waited on the other side.  And as I began a second playthrough that curiosity had diminished and I was left with an seething loathing for the bits that prevented me from getting to the parts I cared about.  At that point I realized that Bioshock Infinite is a charming two to three hour exploration adventure game padded out to seven to ten hours with some absolutely insufferable shooting mechanics that betray everything the *Shock series has ever been known for or good at.  To be clear: It's not a ""You changed it from what it used to be!"" thing.

Can we take video games in a vacuum, divorced from the developers and the greater context which created them?

This episode's a little weird - I've often looked at games that were flawed or maybe a little under appreciated, but I've never really covered a game that simply felt unfinished.  As a result it's a challenge to pull much meaning or value from it - I see snippets of ideas that could have, in some long lost draft or far more refined product, been powerful or resonant.

I honestly can't make heads or tails of the game, which is why we need more discussion about games when they go wrong.  We need writing like Leigh Alexander's Irrational piece ( http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/211139/Irrational_Games_journalism_and_airing_dirty_laundry.php ), the dissection of what happened with The Bureau: XCom Declassified ( http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/19/4614410/xcom-the-bureau-development-2006-2013 ), and the expose of Team Bondi's working conditions ( http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/24/why-did-la-noire-take-seven-years-to-make ).

And we need these open and honest discussions for all sorts of reasons - not just for the sake of the developers working on the games, but for game historians, game critics, and even prospective employees who deserve to know what sort of situation they're really getting themselves into."

It really is a game that works better if you go into it cold, and while I don't reveal *plot* here I do touch on (in the most roundabout ways possible and without revealing too much) some of the bigger ideas at play that make the game work.

Also you should play the game because, seriously, it's pretty awesome and a better way to spend your time than just watching a YouTube video."

Halfway through editing it I realized it didn't know if it wanted to be an essay on Sonic's signature speed as a mechanic or a retrospective of a majority of the Sonic games.  Sometimes it honestly takes that long to decide what I'm doing, and this episode is weaker for it.

Still, I think it manages to capture the overall arc of the franchise nicely, and manages to at least convey my key point - that Sonic was never really about speed originally, but is very much so now."

I was responsible for the majority of the script and some of the slides, but HyperBitHero captured the majority of the footage and edited the entire thing together - and he did a pretty fantastic job!

Be sure to check his stuff out (his three piece analysis of Heavenly Sword is particularly good): http://www.youtube.com/user/HyperBitHero/videos

More than anything, this was a fantastic learning exercise.  Until this point I've sort of been working in isolation - outside of having an occasional person review my scripts to ensure I wasn't saying anything *too* stupid or objectively wrong (which still happens, of course) and this was the first time I've really involved anyone else in the entire process.

Also, I should be back with another (solo) episode within the next few days, so stay tuned!"

Still, I think it's a concept worth bringing up with the gaming community at large.  It's something all gamers are aware of - the idea of visceral combat mechanics, really tight steering controls, or really rewarding jumping mechanics - but something that isn't discussed by designers nearly enough.  Kinaesthetic sensation is truly unique to interactive media, and only in games can it be fully explored."

In celebration, here's a video I posted a few weeks ago to my blip.tv account.  It's about Mirror's Edge, creative risks, and a fat gaptoothed guy with a bad haircut talking about video games.  Unless, of course, a cold, soulless algorithm running on a dusty server in a dark room recognizes ""Still Alive"" and, with no proper understanding of the nature of fair use or the complex legal and corporate mechanizations that wrought it into being, promptly designates this video as infringement.  What's that? No, I'm not bitter at all.

And, because apparently IP trolls, are apparently claiming his music as their own and he suggests attribution to help alleviate that, I do use a snippet of ""Long Road Ahead"" from Kevin McLeod in this video.  His website ( www.incompetech.com ) has some great royalty free songs and I've been a fan of his music and approach to his art for a long time now.

There, now I won't have to talk about IP laws until SOPA/PIPA passes and I can go apeshit for a whole separate set of reasons. Sheesh."
