"XwoA8CpdGuk","International Relations 101 (#2): Sovereignty","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-02","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XwoA8CpdGuk/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

Who are the big actors in international relations? The answer is sovereign states, or the entities that have a monopoly on the use of force within their territory. The notion of sovereignty began in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War.

However, states often violate sovereignty. We will see why they can get away with it next time.

This video was on the longer side of things. I am going to aim to keep them well under ten minutes for the part."
"JceYMndej3Q","International Relations 101 (#3): Anarchy","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-02","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JceYMndej3Q/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

When one state meddles in another state's internal affairs, who punishes the first state? In other words, who is sovereign over the sovereign? The best answer: no one. International relations lives in anarchy, more closely resembling an area ruled by mafia dons than a strong local police force.

However, anarchy does not imply chaos. Anarchy permits anything to happen. Thus, the challenge for us as students of international relations is to be able to predict and explain phenomenon despite the wide-open possibilities."

What type of causal relationships do we want to identify? Did World War I begin because a man with a funny mustache was shot or because of perceived first strike advantages? Did World War II start because of Hitler's actions in Europe or because of war reparations Germany was forced to pay?

Broadly, there are two types of explanations: proximate and underlying causes. We value underlying causes much more than proximate causes because underlying causes give us useful policy recommendations.

However, finding underlying causes is a difficult process. The next video will develop a game plan.

"IYlWEuI3l0s","International Relations 101 (#5): The Strategic World","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-06","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IYlWEuI3l0s/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

In international relations, states are strategically interdependent--how one state acts affects another, and how the other state acts affects the first. Game theory is the study of strategic interdependence, which is why we will heavily rely on its methodology going forward. However, game theory is not perfect. It only maps assumptions into logically valid conclusions. As such, we must make sure we only use sensible assumptions, otherwise we will wind up with potentially silly (but logically valid) conclusions.

This video wraps up the first unit in international relations. Next time, we will explore general models of conflict and cooperation."

Under what conditions will two states cooperate even without a police force to deter conflict? This unit investigates the temptations and incentives for spontaneous cooperation. In the next few videos, we will cover the following:

-The prisoner's dilemma
-The Cult of the Offensive and the origins of World War I
-Arms races and arms treaties
-Tariffs and free trade policy
-The Evolution of Cooperation
-Trench warfare during World War I"
"0gnqTwFkknE","International Relations 101 (#7): The Prisoner's Dilemma","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-08","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0gnqTwFkknE/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

How can individually rational choices lead to collectively bad outcomes? The prisoner's dilemma is the oldest model in game theory and provides an explanation. In the next few videos, we will apply the logic of the prisoner's dilemma to case studies in international relations."
"qCbJxvCTHRc","International Relations 101 (#8): The Cult of the Offensive and the Origins of World War I","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-10","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qCbJxvCTHRc/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

What caused World War I? One trivial explanation is that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand caused Austria-Hungary to make demands unacceptable to Serbia, which led to many countries in Europe mobilizing each other.

However, states curiously mobilized against each other preemptively, shunning the possibility of a diplomatic solution. Why would states prefer a costly war to peace? The so-called ""Cult of the Offensive""--the belief among leaders that offensive technology dominated the defense at the time--provides an explanation.

Read the original article here: http://people.reed.edu/~ahm/Courses/Reed-POL-240-2012-S1_IP/Syllabus/EReadings/06.1/06.1.Van-Evera1984The-Cult.pdf"
"Kc-bgKyPDz4","International Relations 101 (#9): Tariffs and the Barriers to Free Trade","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-11","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kc-bgKyPDz4/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

Prior to World War II, states routinely taxed goods imported into their country. Although this makes domestic products more competitive within the country's own borders, the tariff system led to an overall inefficient economic system. Why were taxes the norm back then, and why is it so difficult to establish free trade?

Modeling free trade as a prisoner's dilemma provides an explanation. Although everyone is collectively better off with free trade, individual incentives tell states to place tariffs on imported goods. Thus, although the result is collectively crazy, it is individually rational.

Yet, in the post-World War II era, free trade has become the norm. As such, this video raises a new question: how is free trade sustainable given the prisoner's dilemma logic? We will explore this type of cooperation after the next lesson."
"K9f5z0Lc888","International Relations 101 (#10): Arms Races","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-12","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K9f5z0Lc888/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

Weapons are expensive to build but provide benefits if one state builds more weapons vis-a-vis its rival. Thus, the prisoner's dilemma describes an arms race: both sides prefer not building weapons to building weapons collectively, but individually each side is better of building regardless of what the other does.

As with the previous lecture on tariffs, you might notice that there have been plenty of successful arms treaties over the decades. We will begin explaining why cooperation can succeed in the face of a prisoner's dilemma in the next video."
"x50rADoxHyc","International Relations 101 (#11): The Shadow of the Future","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-17","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x50rADoxHyc/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

In one-shot prisoner's dilemma interactions, states cannot cooperate because each has individual incentives to defect on the other. However, some interactions take place over the long term. Can states cooperate at the beginning under the threat of defection later on?

Unfortunately, the answer is no. At the end of the interaction, the states must defect on one another. The shadow of the future casts a pall on the present, leading to defection throughout. This holds no matter how long the interaction is."
"4uuPqvMoXzw","International Relations 101 (#12): Grim Trigger","William Spaniel","2012-06-30","2012-07-19","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4uuPqvMoXzw/hqdefault.jpg","http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

Cooperation cannot occur if states know when their prisoner's dilemma interaction will end. What if the end of the interaction is uncertain? Cooperation is possible if the states adopt a policy of tough love---a.k.a. a grim trigger strategy. The states begin by cooperating. Then, as long as everyone has cooperated in the past, they continue cooperating. Otherwise, they defect.

The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod is a classic book on this subject:

In the prisoner's dilemma, we assumed that individuals always wanted to compete with each other. However, most of the time, states act friendly with one another. This lecture models such benevolent cooperation and show that it can fail without coordination among the parties."

Imagine you own a store, and a man trips inside it. He sues you for $40,000 for negligence. Both your lawyer and his lawyer agree there is a 60% chance the lawsuit will be successful, but both of you will have to pay your attorneys $10,000 regardless of the outcome. How should we expect this matter to resolve itself?

Surprisingly, this lawsuit is analogous to war--both are costly and the winners are determined probabilistically if bargaining breaks down."

Can two perfectly intelligent, perfectly unbiased leaders fight wars against each other?

In our investigation of war, we will begin by looking at ""unitary actor explanations."" Specifically, we will assume that states are single entities with no domestic political cleavages. Although that might sound heroic at first, keep in mind that leaders justify wars using these types of explanations. Moreover, if wars can happen even when countries are unified, those causes can still lead to wars even if leaders have incentives for war that their populace does not share."

Can we show that there generally exists a settlement that two sides mutually prefer to war? The answer is yes. This video proves the assertion using the algebraic crisis bargaining model. Next time, we will interpret the results using a geometric model.

How do we interpret the results of the algebraic proof from the previous lecture? Converting the variables into geometric figures helps. This lecture constructs a visual proof by thinking about two states negotiating over where to draw the border between their two capitals. The result shows us the existence of a bargaining range, which is the set of borders that are mutually preferable to war.

To explain why wars break out, we need to relax some assumptions and build additional assumptions into the model. Maintaining tractability requires switching over to a game theoretical model, which we create and solve in this lecture.

http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

When do power shifts lead to war? What is the definition of preventive war? In the standard bargaining model, we assumed that power remained static over time. Here, we abandon that assumption and investigate whether war can occur if a rising state will grow more power over time."

http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

How do overly optimistic beliefs lead to war? Why can't states negotiate a settlement anyway and avoid the costs of fighting? Moreover, if over-optimism causes war and war is costly, why can't states compare their capabilities, match their expectations with reality, and reach a peaceful settlement? This lecture discusses the next rationalist explanation for war: information problems and incentives to misrepresent."

http://gametheory101.com/courses/international-relations-101/

If a bargaining object is all-or-nothing, then we trivially cannot bargain over it. This, in essence, is why issue indivisibility is a rationalist explanation for war. However, side payments can help resolve the issue. This lecture shows why bargaining fails in these instances, how side payments fix the problem, and applies the lessons to the end of the Spanish-American War."

Before, we assumed that the probability of war was the same regardless of who decided to begin the fight. What if we allow for first strike advantages? If the incentives to preempt are great, then we have another rationalist explanation for war. But whether wars truly begin because of first strike advantages--or if first strike advantages merely exacerbate existing problems--remains in debate."

If you have one without the other, peace should prevail. Whereas history textbooks and common narratives of wars tend to focus on grievances, political science research focuses on bargaining problems. The reason is that there are only a couple of types of bargaining problems, whereas the sources of grievances are almost limitless.

Why do states engage in trade? One reason might be because some states are just better at producing goods than other states. This lecture uses the California wine and Mexican tequila industries as an example. California has a good climate for grapes; Mexico has a good climate for agave (the plant that tequila is made from). Naturally, it makes sense for California to make wine and Mexico to make tequila.

But is trade still viable when there aren't the obvious advantages? The answer is yes, and we will look at that case in the next video."

If states can make some products but not others, trade inherently makes sense. But what if a single state is better at making everything? Is trade still sensible? Surprisingly, it is. States can still specialize in what they are comparatively better at making and reap the benefits from trade. This helps explain why international trade is so pervasive and why states try so hard to promote free trade agreements."

We know that trade leaves both parties better off. Then why would states bicker over trade agreements? In this lecture, we see how trade deals can be better for some parties and worse for others. As a result, states have incentive to try to steal all of the surplus of bargaining while simultaneously understanding that failure to reach an agreement leaves everyone worse off. In other words, trade rivalry creates a classic bargaining problem."

Disagreement over how to divide the surplus of trade can result in disputes. How do states mediate such conflict? International courts can help. Despite not having any actual enforcement mechanisms, these courts can coordinate states' expectations and encourage conflict resolution. This lecture draws a parallel to the ""battle of the sexes"" game and shows why states would want to follow through on a court's ruling."

Trade is good for everyone. But some trades leave one side relatively better off in economic terms. While this is fine from a purely economic standpoint, it can cause serious problems from a coercive military standpoint--states can use the relative advantage in trade to purchase more weapons and threaten their trade partners. How do states resolve these issues?"

A and B are correlated if A and B tend to appear together. However, correlation does NOT imply causation. There are many ways in which A and B can be correlated but A does not cause B.

True story: countries with McDonald's restaurants rarely go to war with other countries with McDonald's restaurants. Why? Bic Macs clearly do not cause peace.

Countries that trade with each other fight each other less often. But is the relationship causal? This lecture provides one explanation. Increasing trade increases the opportunity cost for war---it's hard to trade with another country when your soldiers are killing each other on the battlefield. Under most mechanisms that cause conflict, higher costs imply greater peace. This helps explain the observed relationship.

How will the rise of China affect international relations? The democratic peace theory might give us cause for concern, but the capitalist peace tells us that it might not be such a big deal. Thus, China provides a valuable illustration of why we must have a proper understanding of causal mechanisms to provide good policy advice."

In the past, we have seen how bargaining problems and regime types affect the prevalence of war. What about individual leaders? Sometimes, leader incentives do not perfectly match the population's incentives. This creates a principal-agent problem, a mechanism common in political science and economics. We will investigate the usefulness of the theory in this unit."

What does an average democratic leader's retirement look like? What about the average non-democratic leader's retirement?

The Iraq War provides a good example. Things went horribly wrong for both George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein, yet Bush gets to live a cushy retirement while Hussein was hanged. In general, non-democratic leaders are more likely to be jailed, exiled, or killed post-tenure than their democratic counterparts.

In the next lecture, we will discuss how this affects non-democratic leaders' incentives to initiate conflict.

In an experimental study, we randomly assign who receives a treatment variable and who does not. As a result, it is relatively easy to attribute any difference in an outcome variable to the treatment. Unfortunately, we do not have much experimental data in international relations. Observational data, in contrast, can be full of confounding factors. If we are not careful, it will be easy to make mistakes in how we interpret statistical findings.

With economic sanctions in particular, the observational data we receive is full of biases. We will discuss one of the biggest problems in the next lecture."

Due to incentives to misrepresent, it is difficult to differentiate the strong versus the weak in international relations. Costly signals help out here, as types that do not care much about the issues are unwilling to pay such expenses. This can lead to welfare improvement.

In the context of economic sanctions, the lost trade can serve as such a costly signal. Sanctions, while inefficient, occur because they are *less* inefficient than alternative means of conflict resolution."

In discussing the current civil war in Syria, China often mentions how the disastrous UNSC Resolution 1973, which authorized military action against Libya. Yet China did not veto the resolution. Why?

This lecture introduces how states must factor in their rivals' outside options when they vote on the Council. Sometimes, this leads to insincere voting behavior.

At the start of an international crisis, citizens usually ""rally 'round the flag"" to support their leaders. Principal-agent problem mean that leaders could abuse such rallies by instigating unnecessary crises to reap the benefits of the rally.

A public good is non-rival and non-excludable, meaning an individual's consumption of the good does not affect others' consumption and it is impossible to exclude individuals from consuming it.

Public goods often provide enormous benefits at small costs to their providers. However, because public goods are non-rival and non-excludable, those benefits are divided among a large group of individuals. This encourages free riding--why pay the cost when you can gain from everyone else's production?

But this leads to the collective action problem: no one ultimately produces the good, as everyone relies on someone else to do the dirty work."

When a single state enjoys a disproportionately large share of a public good, it may be willing to provide it despite knowing no one else will contribute. Large, powerful states are therefore beneficial in this way to the international system as a whole."

The repeated prisoner's dilemma showed that states can sustain cooperation though the threat of punishment in the future. But punishment in public goods interactions is complicated. For example, one state cannot adequately punish a second state for polluting without also polluting the air of other countries.

The solution is to link issues. Issue linkage allows states to make targeted punishments, which in turn allows for credible cooperation."

But they have also made those already culpable less inclined to give up power, and it's possible that universal jurisdiction might cause leaders to commit atrocities.

Because nuclear weapons provide such a large amount of destructive power, we might wonder whether a state can credibly threaten to use them in a time of crisis. If the answer is no, then nuclear weapons might not provide any coercive benefits.

Looking into crisis statistics, we see two important trends: (1) nuclear weapons states are more likely to prevail in a crisis and (2) crises involving nuclear weapons states tend not to last as long as crises not involving nuclear weapons states. This lecture will provide some intuition as to why this is the case.

If a declining state cannot observe a rising state's proliferation plans and the declining state would prefer to launch preventive war, then the states must act unpredictably or risk being exploited. As a result, preventive war sometimes occurs even though the rising state lacks a nuclear program. Although the result is rational yet appears ridiculous in retrospect.

-domestic social spending is low
-foreign policy platforms are more active
-local grievances are unaddressed
-peace talks are ongoing or about to begin
-domestic physical integrity rights are low
-economic discrimination is high

These all suggest that terrorists are responsive to incentives. Thus, we will investigate strategies of terrorism later in this unit."

Some terrorist groups commit attacks to bait target governments into over-committing in their response. This lecture explains how such operations can backfire and why governments make these mistakes."

Terrorists spoil the trust between the foreign power and a cooperative domestic government by committing attacks to trick the other side into believing that the domestic government is uncooperative. Worse, this trick is not a result of the foreign power making an irrational mistake--the target rationally calculates that the domestic government is more likely to be uncooperative having observed an attack and retaliates accordingly.

This lecture is based off of the following article:

Offensive operations have positive externalities: they destroy terrorist groups and prevent them from attacking any country at all. Defensive strategies have negative externalities: they make attacking other countries look relatively more attractive. Collective action problem theory therefore predicts that offensive operations will be underprovided while defensive strategies will be overprovided."

This unit is on terrorism and insurgency. So far we have only discussed terrorism. However, terrorism is inexorably linked to insurgency, as ongoing civil wars lead to a breakdown institutions, which in turn allows terrorism to fester. Thus, if we are to stamp out terrorism, we must also learn how to end civil wars and kill off the corresponding insurgencies."

The inability to credibly commit to cooperative actions in the future can sabotage a relationship in the present. This lecture explores commitment in police searches. The next lecture will apply the lesson to civil war termination."

While most interstate wars end in negotiated settlements, a vast majority of civil wars end in complete military defeat of one side. Why does bargaining fail? To resolve a civil war, one side must lay down its arms and reintegrate with civil society. But once that side has surrendered, it becomes completely defenseless, allowing the winning side to exploit the losers. Anticipating this, the losing side continues to fight in hopes of turning things around. The result is continued war until one side has finally been defeated."

If commitment problems cause civil wars to drag on, third parties can promote peace by standing in as peacekeepers. But not any third party will work. An enforcer must be strong, have the desire to intervene, and be willing to signal its stance.
