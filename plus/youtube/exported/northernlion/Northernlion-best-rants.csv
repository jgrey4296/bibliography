http://i.imgur.com/3wv4dIK.jpg


Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (50 dollars, Zrock, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
And if he is as wet as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Tap God, Tap God
All the water from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their pockets are deep enough to bling chug, bling chug?
They said I tap like a robot, so call me tapbot

But for me to tap like a consumer must be in my genes
I got a straw in my back pocket
My lips'll go off when I half-swig it.
Got a fat knot from that tap loss
Made a sippin' and a fiddy off it
Ever since barack obama was still in office
With granola bars sticking it's nuts on
I'm an NL still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, cillaholic (Kill 'em all with)"

This is the remastered version of a video I originally uploaded on the ""Trio Cavallo"" channel about a year ago. I decided to remove it from there and put it on my own channel since it was a bit out of context, so I decided to ""remaster"" the original remix, both in audio and visuals effects, also making it to Full HD 60fps.
The original upload got about 54.450 views, in case you were curious.

The guy ""rapping"" over the tune is one of the best content creators of YouTube, the allmighty Egg, the Scumlord Ryan 'Ryab' Northernlion Letourneau, I highly recommend to check his ""Binding of Isaac"" let's play series: https://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion

About Kerbal Space Program:

In KSP you must build a space-worthy craft, capable of flying its crew out into space without killing them. At your disposal is a collection of parts, which must be assembled to create a functional ship. Each part has its own function and will affect the way a ship flies (or doesn't). So strap yourself in, and get ready to try some Rocket Science!"
