For those unfamiliar with what I do, let me introduce the kind of videos I make. I usually take my time and absorb everything I can from the games I play. I also like to examine them; I'll often talk about how the game is affecting me, what I think of it, what works, what doesn't work, and game design. So my videos are typically a mixture of Let's Play, criticism, and examination. I suppose you could say I'm an analytical let's player. I'm no expert, but I love games and I view every game as a new piece of art waiting to be explored.
