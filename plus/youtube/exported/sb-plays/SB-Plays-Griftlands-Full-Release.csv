Griftlands is a new roguelite deckbuilder RPG from Klei Entertainment, makers of excellent games such as Mark of the Ninja, Oxygen Not Included, and Invisible Inc. It uses its procedural generation in some interesting ways and has a fascinating setting, compelling mechanics, and the traditional (extremely high) Klei level of polish.
