Echoes of the Eye is an expansion to the already very nearly perfect Outer Wilds. I have some concerns about that, but at the moment they're being pretty overwhelmed by the feeling of HOORAY, MORE OUTER WILDS! Come out into outer space and die over and over again with me to see which of these two impulses is most justified!
