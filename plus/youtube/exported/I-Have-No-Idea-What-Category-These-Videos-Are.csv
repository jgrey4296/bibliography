Message to artists

I tried very hard to credit ever artist featured, but do to some deleted blogs/ how viral some of these images are, it was occasionally not possible to find a proper source, and theres a chance some of these images could be credited to a blog that featured them as opposed to the artists account themselves. If you see your art in this video uncredited, you can either email my business email (found on my twitter) or reply to the announcement tweet of this video, and we will get you properly credited.
