More about Estate Agent Simulator (from Steam):


Estate Agent Simulator is a property buying, selling and renting game. Buy houses in the city, decorate them and increase their value. Earn income by advertising these houses for rent or for sale. Don't forget to use your bargaining skills!


Construction Vacant land is opportunity! Buy these plots and build your dream house! Construction workers will help you build the house you want.

Customers are coming! Negotiate and try to get the best offer. Try to deal with reputable clients. When the rent day comes, you have to go to the houses and collect the rent money from the tenants, but some customers may not pay the rent. However, if you have a bank account, the rent money will be deposited into your account. Don't forget to check regularly. If you have a problem with a tenant, you can contact a lawyer and sue or try to collect the rent money in other ways. You can even beat them up!




News Centre You need to keep up with what's happening in the city. Neighbourhood factors affect rental prices. If a new school opens in the city, house rents in the neighbourhood may rise. Don't forget to look at newspaper adverts. You can get news about the city by talking to people. Go for a drink. Maybe it will help you to hear what is being said at the next table.


After a tiring day, watch your favorite movie, relax and raise your relationship level with your partner.


Can you drive a van? Go to the dealer in the city, buy the stuff and increase the value of the house you want to rent out. Be careful not to forget to take your lorry with you, the stuff is quite heavy.


Entertainment: You deserve to have some fun too! Try to discover the venues in the city. In some places you will have fun and earn money at the same time."

More about Space Trash Scavenger (from Steam):

In the 31st century, Space Trash Scavengers employed by ScavCorp roam the cosmos, risking their lives for riches amongst the debris of an ancient war.

Build your Space Rig–a 3D raft with artificial gravity, power, trash processing, farming and defense. Craft the everyday food, fuel, weapons, ammo and space suit upgrades you’ll need to survive out here in the vastness of the cosmos.

In space there is no up or down! Expand your base in any direction for the most efficient layout. Once you are equipped with the necessary fuel and a warp drive, you’ll be free to explore other sectors and continue your mission.

Circumnavigate tiny asteroids, fly between abandoned outposts, and board derelict spaceships as they orbit the system. Take caution, however, and remember to keep your jetpack fuel topped up–you’ll need it to get back to your Space Rig safe and sound!

Each salvage zone is a procedurally generated, dynamic, and ever-changing open world.

You are an employee for the galaxy’s number one waste disposal firm, stranded far away from home with a mission to clean the galaxy from the remains of a galactic war.Space trash is your main resource. Whether it is salvaged debris floating in space, advanced and rare tech from wrecked ships, or scavenged goods from asteroid surfaces, you’ll want to snatch it all up!

Recycle and refine it to produce valuable goods that will net a tidy sum on the Trash Exchange, and spend it to upgrade your kit.

You’re not alone amid the wreckage. Alien bots patrol most sectors of space nowadays and they’ll be drawn to you as your operation expands.

You’ll need a steady aim, impeccable defenses, and an upgraded armory to protect your Space Rig from the dangers of these foes. Survival depends on your ability to defend yourself!

...and more!
We'll be adding more and more to Space Trash Scavenger, so be sure to wishlist and follow for updates! Join our discord (linked to the right) if you'd like to help beta test the game."

More about Cities: Skylines II (from Steam):

If you can dream it, you can build it.
Raise a city from the ground up and transform it into the thriving metropolis only you can imagine. You've never experienced building on this scale. With deep simulation and a living economy, Cities: Skylines II delivers world-building without limits.

Lay the foundations for your city to begin. Create the roads, infrastructure, and systems that make life possible day to day. It's up to you – all of it.

How your city grows is your call too, but plan strategically. Every decision has an impact. Can you energize local industries while also using trade to boost the economy? What will make residential districts flourish without killing the buzz downtown? How will you meet the needs and desires of citizens while balancing the city's budget?

Your city never rests. Like any living, breathing world, it changes over time. Some changes will be slow and gradual, while others will be sudden and unexpected. So while seasons turn and night follows day, be ready to act when life doesn't go to plan.

An ever-expanding community of Builders means more opportunities to build a truly groundbreaking city with mods. They're now more easily available in Cities: Skylines II.

The most realistic and detailed city builder ever, Cities: Skylines II pushes your creativity and problem-solving to another level. With beautifully rendered high-resolution graphics, it also inspires you to build the city of your dreams.
Deep simulation
AI and intricate economics mean your choices ripple through the fabric of the city. Remember that as you strategize, problem-solve, and react to change, challenges, and opportunities.
Epic scale, endless possibilities
Cities: Skylines II lets you create without compromise. Now you can build sky-high and sprawl across the map like never before. Why not? Your city is you.
Cities that come alive
Your decisions shape each citizen's life path, a chain of events that defines who they are. From love and loss to wealth and wellbeing, follow their life's ups and downs.
A dynamic world
Pick a map to set the climate of your city. These are the natural forces you'll negotiate to expand your city amid rising pollution, changeable weather, and seasonal challenges."

I Turned This Entire Game Into a Glitchy Pain Paradise - The Coin Game - Let's Game It Out

----------

Check it out on Steam ► https://store.steampowered.com/app/598980/The_Coin_Game/

More about The Coin Game (from Steam):

The Coin Game is a fun collection of ticket arcades that are all run by goofy robots on an little island full of things to do. The arcades include highly detailed machines with realistic physics that are inspired by modern arcade machines. There are ticket redemption areas to exchange your counted tickets for all kinds of fun prizes. Larry's Arcade has an in-house animatronic band called Teddy and the Ticket Eaters that would love to play you some tunes while you enjoy the arcade. The most recent addition to Islandville island, UFO Arcade features modern space inspired arcade machines, Lazer Tag and an Indoor Go Kart Race Track. Make sure to watch out for the minions, they really love Teddy and his band and they also are pretty good at Lazer Tag. Run out of money? That's ok. You can work odd jobs around the island to get back on your feet. Got extra prizes? The island has a Pawn Shop that will buy your used prizes for cash so you can go blow it back at the arcade.

The Coin Game also features a full fledged Traveling Carnival with over 20 classic games, rides and machines to choose from. The carnival also brings new prizes to win, hoard or sell for cash at Barrys pawn shop. The rides are all interactive and are overpriced just like in real life... so you better be winning, working or begging Uncle Phil for more spending cash if you want to enjoy them. (Birthday mode is unlimited money for all you lazies out there that just want to live off of Uncle Phils wallet and have a good time. So dont worry he has you covered). But dont get comfy as Survivor Mode is still being developed. ;)

You can play The Coin Game anyway that you like. For the laid back players, you can just play the fun games and win tickets to exchange for silly prizes. You don't have to worry about anything but winning tickets. Unlimited money. No curfews. No rules.... just arcade freedom brought to you by your rich Uncle Phil.

The Coin Game includes all the fun activities of a real trip to the arcade. Including drinking soda all day, dodging sugar filled minions and living off of vending machine cheesy poofs. To earn a little extra money you can scavenge the dumpsters and trash cans or even deliver newspapers around the island for extra spending loot. Explore the island on the Islandville bus system or even your very own golf cart.

There is lots of highway traffic and tourist activity on the island all year round, so make sure to keep off the roads or you may get a little surprise. There is even a few areas planned for the future that are off limits for now and surrounded by construction fencing to keep you safe. The Islandville Transit bus is always running if you need to get around the island doing chores. To hail the bus, simply click the button in any bus stop and buy a bus pass. Each bus ride costs one pass ($1.50).

With over 40 different games and machines there is already plenty to do on the island. You can play The Coin Game with any mouse, keyboard or any Dual stick/pad controller. The game includes a easy to use key mapping system to support virtually any controller or peripheral. So you can play The Coin Game any way that you like.

The Coin Game is developed by a one man indie developer over the last 3 years with the wonderful support of his wife, family and 2 weiner dogs."

I Became a Multimillionaire and Turned New York City Into a Total Wasteland - Big Ambitions

A key for Big Ambitions was provided by the developers, Hovgaard Games.

----------

Check it out on Steam ► https://store.steampowered.com/app/1331550/Big_Ambitions/

More about Big Ambitions (from Steam):

Your bank balance is tiny, but your ambitions are big.

With a little help from your uncle, you get an apartment and your first job. But then it's up to you to achieve success and take over New York City any way you like.

Slowly build multiple small businesses, grow them into huge corporations, or carve your own unique path – the possibilities are limitless in this vast business sandbox. You've never played anything like this!

Go from a small apartment and public transport to luxury suites, fast cars and designer furniture. Put your money into investment funds and real estate. Succeed, fail, rebuild. But remember to take care of yourself, sleep and stay happy on your rise to the top.

Do you have what it takes to build your own empire?


Go from nothing to the most prominent tycoon in New York. Start a business, work smart, make it thrive and enjoy your life. How do you want to be successful? How far can you push it? How long can you make it last?

Start your own gift shop, supermarket, coffee shop, law firm, clothing store, liquor store, florist, and more. You decide what success is - whether it’s a single shop, a chain of fast-food restaurants, a huge corporation, or making millions developing websites.

Take out a loan, rent a building, design the logo, renovate the store, get stock, manage your money, hire staff, and build your infrastructure. Soon, you may have to start importing products from the harbour and distributing them through a network of warehouses.

A bigger business means managers. Hire HR Managers, Logistics Managers, and Purchasing Agents. They all need desks and computers, so you’ll need a fancy headquarters.

Need a delivery truck? Travel to a dealer and buy one. Need food? Go to a supermarket, but make sure you have a refrigerator at home. Big Ambitions is a life sim where your character has to physically interact with the world to survive and succeed.

Enter any building in New York and buy it. Go from a small apartment to a dream penthouse in midtown, a luxurious townhouse in Hell’s Kitchen, or a series of skyscrapers. Fill each with furniture that suits your style and standing. Invest your hard-earned cash in real estate to grow your empire. Take over the city piece by piece.

Spend your wealth however you wish. Buy a big SUV, a speedy sports car, or the new luxurious Mersaidi S500. Maybe risk it all at the casinos or put your money into investment funds and reap the rewards.

As you progress, you always need to ensure you get enough sleep and stay healthy and happy. Enjoy the journey, for as you grow older, you’ll discover that money can’t buy you time... or can it?

Big Ambitions takes what you love about the viral sensation ‘Startup Company’ to even greater heights."

I Turned a Fun Road Trip Into a Nightmare Voyage - The Long Drive - Let's Game It Out

----------

Check it out on Steam ► https://store.steampowered.com/app/1017180/The_Long_Drive/

More about The Long Drive (from Steam):

This is a road trip game in an almost infinite random generated desert. The focus is on freedom, driving, exploration and immersion. It has minimal car maintenance and survival elements.

Infinite Desert, Freedom and Driving:
There are no invisible walls or unable to jump over small fences, or blinking red ""wrong direction"" signs on the hud. The car won't need 10-20 liter fuel over just only a few hundred meters, with a full tank, you could go approximately 500 kilometers. If you see a distant big mountain, you can go there and if you are capable, you can climb it. If you don't like where the mirrors are facing you can adjust them however you want or throw them away while driving at full speed. If you want to lean out of the car, or closer to the radio or near anything, you can."

Your kitchen’s got all the gear a chef might need. Griddles, cookers, gas stands, ovens and tons of utensils like pots, pans, plates, knives, spatulas and blenders! We made sure that you can freely interact with all this stuff using your VR hands. On top of that there are over 140 ingredients available in the pantry: meat and fish, fruit and veggies, dairy products and various liquids. There’s also a full set of spices and herbs for adding that extra flavour!

Lifelike cooking experience! All the ingredients respond to your actions by changing temperature, appearance and taste. Every time you’re slicing potatoes, flipping steaks or boiling a soup, there is some real-life physics applied to it. Each product has a different resistance to the knife and you can feel it through haptic feedback of your VR controllers.
Once you learn the cooking mechanics and start serving dishes, you’ll see yourself becoming a better chef with every new plate on the checkout.

Career mode is a culinary journey zero-to-hero style and your task is to gain fame for you and your restaurant.

Once you master the recipes and workflow, you’ll be able to unlock various perks and skills.

However, if you’re not interested in playing by the rules, you’re going to love the Sandbox mode. Access all the recipes and ingredients and prepare whatever you like without any pressure. You don’t even have to cook anything! Game physics gives you unlimited opportunities. Use a slow-motion button to cut veggies in the air, set up cutting boards like dominoes, set the whole kitchen on fire, blow up the oven and save the day using a fire extinguisher!"

I Became a Millionaire by Ruining a Homeless Person's Life in Hobo Tough Life - Let's Game It Out

----------

Check it out on Steam ► https://store.steampowered.com/app/632300/Hobo_Tough_Life/

More about Hobo: Tough Life (from Steam):

Hobo: Tough Life is an urban survival role-playing game where you play as a homeless person. Play alone or team up in online co-op. Explore the streets of Praslav, scavenge for food and supplies, beg, steal, and do whatever else it takes to survive the forthcoming winter.

Welcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades.

While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go.

You are one of those people.

Keep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point.

How far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are.

Spend the last few days of autumn wisely – gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again.

Unlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav.

Maybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own.

Is surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter.

For over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?"

More about Medieval Dynasty (from Steam):

Europe in the early Middle Ages -- Nobles and clergy rule and the trade between nations brings prosperity as well as envy, distrust, and greed. Military conflict is everywhere and entire continents are changing.

In Medieval Dynasty, you take on the role of a young man who has fled from war and wants to take his fate into his own hands. From being alone, inexperienced and poor you will develop into a master of many skills, a leader of your community and the founder of a prosperous dynasty which is meant to last and prosper for generations to come. Defending against wild animals while hunting for food, gathering resources and crafting equipment, building a house and erecting a whole bustling village while founding a family all contribute to a unique gameplay experience across many genres. Tough winters and unexpected events challenge your skills and dexterity as you strive to build your own legacy.

You can choose to follow the main chapters, solve the questlines or just roam around and explore the vast medieval world – but be careful as wolves or bears may try to take a bite from you... Begin with the simplest things for your own survival like hunting and farming as well as building yourself a home. Found a family and have a heir - entice others to live near and work for you, erect many other buildings to transform your settlement into a vibrant village and, ultimately, a thriving dynasty that will reign for generations.

A massive medieval open 3D world awaits… Be aware of harsh winters and unexpected events while honing your skills to turn from a medieval survivor into the ruler of a dynasty. Grab your axe, hammer, or hunting bow - and craft your legacy!

More about Raft (from Steam):

By yourself or with friends, your mission is to survive an epic oceanic adventure across
a perilous sea! Gather debris to survive, expand your raft and be wary of the dangers of
the ocean!

Trapped on a small raft with nothing but a hook made of old plastic, players awake on a vast,
blue ocean totally alone and with no land in sight! With a dry throat and an empty stomach,
survival will not be easy!

Raft throws you and your friends into an epic adventure out on the big open sea, with the
objective to stay alive, gather resources and build yourself a floating home worthy of
survival.

Resources are tough to come by at sea: Players will have to make sure to catch whatever debris floats by using their trusty hook and when possible, scavenge the reefs beneath the waves and the islands above.
However, thirst and hunger is not the only danger in the ocean… watch out for the man-
eating shark determined to end your voyage!


Features:
● Multiplayer! Survive by yourself or with friends in online co-op!
● Hook! Use your hook to catch debris floating by.
● Craft! Build survival equipment, weapons, crop plots and more to help you stay alive!
● Build! Expand your raft from a simple wreckage to a buoyant mansion.
● Research! Learn new things to craft in the research table.
● Navigate! Sail your raft towards new places!

● Fight! Defend your raft from the dangers of the ocean."

HISTORY
 Choose a royal or noble house from a number of realms on a map that stretches from Iceland to India, from the Arctic Circle to Central Africa.
 Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy.
 Be a pious king to bring the religious powers to your side, or strike out on your own, designing your own splinter religion and earning everlasting fame or eternal damnation.

CHARACTER
 Adopt one of five different lifestyles, perfecting your skills in military strategy or kingdom management.

 Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies.
 Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm.
 Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars.
 Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms.

I Built an Airport of Suffering Where Nobody Is Safe - SimAirport - Let's Game It Out

----------

Check out the game here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/598330/SimAirport/

About SimAirport:

You control everything, from the cruise-altitude decisions to the smallest ground-level details.

Challenge yourself to create an efficient & profitable international hub in Career Mode, or create an artistic masterpiece without credit rating worries in Sandbox Mode.

Construct your terminal, hire staff, sign airline contracts, tweak the daily flight schedule, configure standby gate availability, plan & design your infrastructure -- bag handling systems, roads & taxiways, fuel systems, runways, gates, hangars, service vehicles, and everything in between. Deeply simulated gameplay where each detail makes an impact -- down to the trash cans.

Simple & familiar controls for a smooth takeoff
The starter airport helps get aircraft landing & cash flowing almost immediately. Aim for profitability by scaling up, but remember: more passengers, more problems! Getting 2,000 pax out is easy. Avoiding bottlenecks for 10k+ pax will likely require different tactics!

Large & complex airports require extremely smart designs.
Moving walkways, multi-story structures, additional terminals, one-way taxiways, staggered schedules, and careful standby gate allocation -- these are but a sampling of the concepts you'll leverage on your way to truly mastering the art of large-scale airport operations.

One size does NOT fit all.
It seems simple, placing restrooms or retail areas for instance -- but it's more than meets the eye! Pax may become distracted when seating or interesting services require a long walk or are far from their gate! Carefully consider the details to truly maximize your efficiency and reap the profits.

Happy Pax, Happy Airline.
Getting flights out on-time is only part of the battle. Ensuring passengers catch their flight is another. When operations run smoothly & pax are all happily catching their flights you can be pretty sure that the airlines are probably satisfied, too! If you keep the airlines happy you can probably raise prices without creating too much fuss -- and that leads to bigger profits!

Core Gameplay
Career Mode & Sandbox Mode (unlimited funds)
16+ Aircraft, turboprop to turbine. 15 Airlines with realistic high-quality textures.
15+ research items to obtain improved transit, reporting, expansion, and other capabilities

Comprehensive Fuel System Simulation
Fuel can be a profitable saving grace or you may even decide to sell at-or-below cost as a loss-leader tactic in your effort to gain favor with airlines. Leverage the Fuel Marketplace as much as you can, too -- with enough capacity you may be able to cash in on any arbitrage opportunities that present themselves which can provide a welcome capital infusion.

Deeply Simulated Baggage Handling Systems
Conveyor to carousel, every single bag is tracked -- watch as each piece of luggage makes its journey. Losing bags is a sure way to upset an individual pax, but it also starts causing issues with the airline when occurring often. Bag handling systems can be quite complicated and you definitely don't want to become a case study like KDEN has! Take it slow and plan ahead -- building a highly efficient baggage handling operation is no easy task and requires careful planning!

Pax Info Systems
Info displays, kiosks, and public address speaker systems complete with Electronics zones to house the required amplifiers. Keep pax informed and they'll have a greater sense of urgency as their departure time nears and they're be far less likely to needlessly wander from their gate.

Robust Queues
Extremely powerful queue system provides you with full control. Supports numerous configurations include 'one-to-many' desks, to assign a single queue to multiple service stations. Optionally allows restrictions to be set per queue to allow/restrict certain types of people from using the queue (First Class, Coach, and Flight Crew) which you can leverage to create expedited queues for operational efficiency purposes."

Thanks again to Paradox for sponsoring!

About Surviving the Aftermath:

Survive and thrive in a post-apocalyptic future — resources are scarce but opportunity calls. Build the ultimate disaster proof colony, protect your colonists and restore civilization to a devastated world. Remember: The end of the world is just the beginning.

NO PLACE LIKE HOME
Build and manage a colony of survivors after a world-ending event. Construct more than 50 unique buildings to handle everything from resource collection and farming to exploration and security. Don’t forget to construct the Gate to venture into the savage world beyond your colony.

SURVIVING EARTH
Explore a vast procedurally generated world featuring six different biomes filled with exploitable resources, bandits, and more. Each environment has different conditions that will affect your colony’s survival. Stay vigilant: Natural disasters will put your survivors to the test.

SURVIVAL IS MY SPECIALTY
Recruit over 46 unique Specialists, each with their own skills and motivations, to manage your colony’s resources and production. Send them beyond the Gate on scientific missions, scavenger runs, and to fight bandits.

EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED
Life in the aftermath requires you to make moral choices. You may not be able to control everything in your colony, but how you respond to situations and emergent events will shape the character of your new civilization.

Contribute to the future of Surviving the Aftermath - new content incorporating players feedback will be added regularly throughout development.

About This Game

Design and build your own hospital!

Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful – or functional – healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County.

Optimize your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible.

Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in.

Cure unusual illnesses

Don’t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine.

Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. You can handle a single patient – but can you handle a Pandemic?

Once you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut.

Improve and expand your hospital horizons!

Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next?

Once you’ve cured the residents of a small harbor village, can you take on a bigger challenge in a busier hospital?

Improve your facilities, upgrade machines, staff and layouts to make more money, more quickly.

Train and improve your staff, leveling them up with new skills and abilities to make your hospital even more efficient.

Make use of the extensive statistic and information screens to analyse your strengths and weaknesses, and make rapid alterations. Adjust the price of your treatments, keep an eye on your turnover, take out loans and optimize your earnings.

You’ll be managing staff with unique personality types and traits, so you’ll need to keep an eye on who’s being efficient – and who is just a pain in the neck. Balance your workforce with your ambitions as you strive to make profit (and hopefully save some people along the way)."

Check it out on Steam! ► https://store.steampowered.com/app/623700/Rec_Center_Tycoon/

More about Rec Center Tycoon (from Steam):

What is Rec Center Tycoon?
Rec Center Tycoon draws inspiration from the simulation-management classics like Theme Hospital as well as modern classics like Prison Architect to give you a deep, challenging business management game where you build and run a recreation center from the ground up.

Micromanage employees, finances, fitness classes, customer needs and much more!

Key features
Sandbox gamemode with Career mode coming soon.
Micromanage employees to get the best performance out of them while keeping them happy.
Challenging gameplay; unlike many other management games, failure is a possibility in Rec Center Tycoon, you must keep your customers happy or they may leave negative reviews which can hurt future business leading poor profits.
Large selection of buy-able exercise equipment to keep customers satisfied.
Many different types of employees, from your simple receptionist to a boxing trainer.
Every employee has different motivations, skill levels & traits. Some employees may prefer short 5 hour shifts, others are happy to work 12 hour shifts. An unfit, yet charismatic employee won't make a good lifeguard, but they might make a great receptionist.
It's up to you to choose the right employee for the job!
Hire trainers & create your own fitness classes.
Host customer parties in your Event Rooms for an added source of income.
Running low on money? Take out a loan from the bank! Beware of the interest rates though.
Complex financial system. Do you charge a flat rate for entry? Or make entry free but dramatically increase the cost of amenities like café food and arcade machines? Do you lock facilities like swimming behind a membership? What will your daily membership costs be?

What's planned
Career game-mode
Host your own swimming/basketball/boxing tournaments
Hire & train athletes to compete in these tournaments
Host School events to earn $$$
Additional professions like Nurse, Security Guard etc..
Larger selection of equipment
Complex weather system

On early-access release Rec Center Tycoon will only be available for the Windows platform with possibilities for Mac & Linux support added after."

Throw knives like darts, set up cutting boards like dominoes, set the whole kitchen on fire, blow up the oven and save the day using a fire extinguisher!"

Buoyancy is a city-building strategy game set in an ocean world.

Manage a growing population. Your city's population will be ever growing! Manage your villagers happiness and nourishment levels to keep them alive. Try to balance resource production with an increasing population that demands more and more. Combat sickness and fires that could cripple your city.

Explore with your mighty city. In this ocean world there are resources and floating junk to exploit but they’re not always going to drift your way. You can move your city around to exploit resources providing your buildings a production boost. Most of these resources are critical to develop larger cities, and some are necessary to keep surviving!
Find schools of fish, derelict ships, and take advantage of rebounded whale populations (or don’t).

Fight for your survival. Pirates will attack you if they spot your city. You can train Guards to defend your city from invaders. Place Junk Cannons to destroy a large amount of pirates in one blow, but be careful of friendly fire!

More about Incident Commander (from Steam):

A small town faces a big problem, and the crisis will only get worse unless you step in. As Incident Commander, you deploy and coordinate responder teams from multiple organizations to deal with a sudden threat to the town’s citizens and property.

Incident Commander uses a simplified approach to the Incident Command System. The focus is on operations. Players control police, fire, EMS, air operations, school, and public works units in real-time to deal with the emerging disaster.

The game supports one to five players. There is an Incident Command System framework for you to set up, but the framework does not force players into roles. Instead, players must learn to cooperate and divide the responsibilities for the most efficient operation. Player communication and delegation are crucial for success. Otherwise, responder teams may receive conflicting orders from different players.

A tutorial and several scenarios provide many types of challenges, including fires, chemical spills, looting, electrical hazards, school shooting, and casualty collection. The town mayor will keep an eye on your progress and track Public Safety and Incident Budget. Are you up to the task, Commander?

KEY FEATURES
Bird’s-eye view of 3D world with animations and special effects such as damage from fires, toppled utility poles, chemical spills, and explosions
Tutorial scenario explains how to assign tasks to units and call in nearby resources
Cooperative multiplayer feature supports up to five players
Events unfold in real-time play as you race to keep ahead of the situation
Includes over 20 different types of teams and vehicles, from School Resource Officer to HAZMAT
Use a helicopter to rescue citizens from danger or drop water on raging wildfires
Neutralize threats by Assault, Negotiation, or Arrest and book them at the Police Station
Use Wildland Engines to carry Firefighters off road to battle the fire from any side
Employ Lockdown and Escort tactics to keep students safe during a school shooting
Set up the Joint Information Center so Media Teams will not interfere with responders
Repair utility hazards with Public Works squads, and use a Tow Truck to remove vehicles from danger

More about Founder's Fortune (from Steam):

A fantasy colony simulator focusing on creative building, colonist psychology and base defense. Handle resources, farming, production, tools, weapons, armor, trading, defense, and research, as well as the wishes, expectations, thoughts, and possessions of every colonist.

Build Your Colony
When your colonists arrive, they have nothing but the clothes on their backs. You take control and tell them to gather materials and build walls, floors and furniture.

You are not limited to predefined buildings! Design your own houses and style them to your liking. There are dozens of construction and furniture elements that you can use to create the settlement you’ve always dreamed of!

Take Care Of Your Colonists
The colonists are your top priority. At first, you simply need to provide them with food and shelter. But the world is full of dangers! An infection might prove fatal to the strongest warrior and a plague can wipe out your entire colony.

Each colonist reacts to events, happy or sad, and reflects that in their behavior. Happy colonists will receive a boost to their productivity – Unhappy colonists might throw a temper tantrum.

Deal With Tantrums
In an ideal life, all your wishes come true, at least that’s what Toni thinks. Fulfilled wishes can promote good moods, while hunger, injuries, boring conversations, or even nightmares will make your citizens feel bad.

If you ignore the needs and wishes of your colonists for too long, one of them might have a breakdown and throw a trantrum.

At That Point, All Bets Are Off…

Set up your Farm
Food matters. Good food makes colonists happy, wrong food makes colonists sick, little food makes colonists slow, and no food makes colonists die.
Grow a variety of seasonal crops and set up a kitchen to make delicious meals. Be sure to stock up before winter hits and act quick when a swarm of hungry bugs descends upon your fields!

Survive Winter
Use the time you have and make sure you have enough food stored away, for winter is coming. Let’s hope you won’t have to halve rations – because that will make your colonists weak.
When supplies dwindle and the freezing cold wind howls outside, it’s easy to lose hope.

Trade Goods and Get Rich
Word got around that your colony has started producing wares. Greet traveling traders and see if you can get a good deal on some ancient scrolls or buy additional food to prepare for winter.
Try to keep production up so you’ll always have something to sell. A mature colony needs to pay good salaries to keep everyone happy. If morale is low, additional funds can even buy a tiny bit of happiness!

Research Technologies
Building your home is a long process and resources and manpower are not the only things you need. Smart Settlers dedicate a lot of time to researching new technologies, thereby unlocking better equipment, new furniture and construction elements.
Select scholars carefully – if their personality doesn’t fit this type of work, they are not going to make a lot of progress.

Protect Your Outpost
You are not alone in this new land you call ‘home’. The Tikigoblins living there are not all that happy about your settling efforts and might pay you a visit to try to get you to stop.
Train your colonists in the art of warfare and equip them with the best weapons and armor you have. Build walls and towers to ensure the security of your colony – that way, your enemies will have a difficult time trying to mess with you!

More about Police Simulator: Patrol Duty (from Steam):

Experience the exciting day-to-day life of an US police officer in Police Simulator: Patrol Duty. Discover a large, lively and freely-accessible US city powered by Unreal® Engine 4 and ensure the safety in your district. Record traffic accidents, search for stolen vehicles and arrest criminals. Support other police officers at traffic checkpoints, flag down speeders and write them up. Stop and check every citizen or car you want and enforce the law. Pay attention to fugitive suspects and chase them on foot or by car with lights flashing and sirens blaring. Investigate crime scenes, interrogate witnesses and search for evidence.

Get behind the wheel of three realistically recreated police vehicles with functional cockpits and use the in-car-computer to identify wanted suspects and stolen vehicles. Start with a typical police sedan and change to an all-terrain SUV and a fast police muscle car while you progress in the game. Use the siren to stop cars or to pave your way through heavy traffic in an emergency. If you crash or damage your car, you will not only have visible crash deformations, the handling of the car will also become more difficult.

Patrol either alone or together with a friend in the 2-player cooperative multiplayer mode and rush to resolve emergencies. Detect suspicious behaviours and prevent criminal operations.

Your exciting job in a lively city covering more than 3.8 square miles leads you through three individual districts - the financial, industrial and residential district. Use authentic law enforcement equipment like handcuffs, radios and radar guns to protect your city!

More about Oxygen Not Included (from Steam):

In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving...

Just make sure you don't forget to breathe.

Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive
Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.


It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations:
Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.

Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics:
Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.

Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations:
Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.

Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations
Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.

Always Keep Yourself Breathing:
Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.

Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling
Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you’re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts.

Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds:Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds:
Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them!

More about Meeple Station (from Steam):

DISCLAIMER: Meeple Station is in active development and is therefore subject to constant change. Nothing is representative of final gameplay. We update as often as possible so during it's Alpha state, There-Will-Be-Bugs. We try our best to smash them as soon as we're aware of them so most bugs are fixed shortly after patch-days. We'd appreciate if you gave the in-game bug report button a nice hard punch and let us know if you encounter any during your play - it helps us quickly get them fixed. We always endeavor greatly to not break saves- because that's annoying, but it's not always avoidable. Thankfully we've only had to do that once so far. So sorry bout that one, but ya' can't win 'em all.
So What Is Meeple Station?

So What Is Meeple Station?

Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee!
Meeple need things to live!

Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire.

Trade!

At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets.
Fight off lazy pirates!

Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers.

We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem.

More about Flashing Lights - Police, Firefighting, Emergency Services Simulator  (from Steam):

FLASHING LIGHTS
Enrol with the police, emergency medical services or fire department and take on missions unique to each service in an open world. Engage in desperate car chases, diagnose life-threatening injuries, and put out lethal fires! Each department has its own vehicles and equipment for you to operate while on duty. Play in single player, or work together with friends in online multiplayer to tackle incidents across a shared world.

Usually the first to respond to a criminal incident, the police are equipped with the fastest vehicle and a variety of equipment. Their roles vary from handing out parking tickets to chasing down dangerous suspects. They’ll do everything they can to prevent criminal activity and put a stop to any crimes in progress.

As an emergency medical specialist, your job lies in keeping members of the public alive, treating patients’ injuries, diagnosis and more. Lifesaving equipment you’ll utilise includes medical kits, stretchers and ambulances.

The role of the fire department extends far beyond putting out flames, as they work closely with medical services out in the field, swiftly cutting open crashed cars so that medical staff can reach the casualty. The fire department won’t engage in the pursuit of suspects, but will handle the aftermath of an incident, including, of course, putting out fires. Battling raging flames and freeing trapped civilians involves some heavy-duty gear including spreaders, a fire hose, a fire extinguisher and a fire truck.

MULTI-PLAYER
Team up with fellow players online and divide your team between the three emergency services at will. Race around the open world in various vehicles, to where you are needed, working together to help civilians in accidents or catch a fleeing criminal.

MISSIONS
Various calls to action will see you responding to incidents based on your chosen department, as well as the relevant area in the open world. From speeding and illegal parking, to raging fires and life-threatening car accidents, the pressure is on in Flashing Lights.

THE WORLD
Flashing Lights features a thriving open world (currently 3.5KM x 3.5KM) that will see emergencies break out in all corners of life.

Early Access
All screenshots on this page are a work in progress, and visuals are subject to change. It is our plan to expand the open world to include different environments, missions and scenarios. We will also be adding further emergency services equipment and gameplay mechanics throughout the Early Access period.

More about Overcrowd A Commute 'Em Up (from Steam):

Every day, millions crowd the metro in a desperate bid to get to work. Can you build and run the perfect metro station to help them make it on time?

Overcrowd is a tactical management sim set on the metro of bustling city Lubdon Town. Blending base building with pausable real-time strategy, Overcrowd offers a unique mix of spatial puzzling, strategic thinking and split-second choices.

Excavate your way through 4 layers of earth. Design your layout carefully and plot commuter routes with user-defined directional signs. Keep things on track with a wide range of equipment to unlock and procure.

You’ll need to assemble a crack team, tool them up and deploy them to run your station in real time. You can set priorities, schedule breaks or just deploy them manually. Keep your staff room well stocked and your employees levelled and you can take you tube station to new depths.

Commuters have needs, just like you and me. The hazards of a badly run station - delays, heat, dirt, rats - will affect their state of mind and your station reputation. Beware hoodlums and pickpockets who will try to derail your operation!

Everything from bin emptying, generator refueling, power, litter collection, heat, commuter AI, shop prices, stock and staff activities are simulated down to the individual level. The huge range of interacting systems gives scope for emergent and unpredictable gameplay.

- Procedural campaign. Build a network of stations in the procedural campaign, procuring more tech and hiring staff as you go. Return to past stations when you have more resources and try to earn a full 5 star rating!
- Sandbox mode. Define everything from money, staff, map size and win/lose states. Make the game as easy, as hard or as creative as you want.
- Commute of the day. Build a station on a randomly generated map, unique to that day.

More about DIY Simulator (from Steam):

DIY Simulator is teaching everyone how to build DIY (DO IT YOURSELF) objects like electric skateboards, drones, power banks, portable speakers, wireless chargers and many more.

By having a day and night cycle, you need to sleep because if you get tired, you cannot work.

The assembly system (building system) is user-friendly, you just need to go to the garage and interact with the workbench and a simple menu will appear. From that menu, you can choose what object to build, you can see the parts needed and the final cost (if you buy the parts from the store).

In the bedroom, you can find a computer that has a few applications:
File Manager - is used for reading and showing texts and images
Browser - is used to buy parts
Mail - is used to see orders/quests
Bank - is used to see transactions and balance
3D Printer - is used to write to USB stick models for the printer
The parts will arrive after 1 to 3 days in a box, at his mailbox. Sending an object (or more) to the owner needs to be done in the same way and will be done at the mailbox, but the boxes will be picked when the courier comes. Later in the game, you can build your own car (from parts) and you can go and pick and/or ship the packages if you don't want to wait.
Sleeping is not the only thing you need to do, you also need to drink, eat and to go to the toilet.
Buying food and water can be made from the local market.
Low on money? No problem, you can find used or not working parts/objects at the traders from the scrap yard and you can get the good parts and create a good and new object.

Be careful, outside the village are wild animals like wolves and boars. The safest way is to go with your car, or if you don't have one, just ..don't go! They can kill you, or damage your car.

By using your mobile phone, you can see your orders, emails, and bank account.

You can use the ATM from the market to withdraw or deposit money.

You are the police – Send appropriate forces with specific vehicles (from patrol car to SWAT unit) to dangerous emergency missions to keep your city safe. Provide them with the right gear from snipers to tracker dogs, bomb defusal kits and much more…

Bring back prisoners and evidence from the crime scenes, interrogate them and process the files to earn money. You will need the funds to set up for big events like the trial of a mafia boss or preparations for the football championship ending up in major riots in your city.

You are the fire brigade – Get ready for the rush of incoming emergencies and make sure your team has the right vehicles and resources to handle them. Train your firefighters to develop unique skills allowing them to become experts for specific mission types. Assign them to different shifts based on their skills and supply them with special gear from air tanks to hazmat suits for chemical emergencies.

You are the ambulance – Look after your patients in the medical station of your HQ and expand it with the latest technologies from radiology stations to 3D printers. It’s your responsibility to keep all your patients safe and provide your medic team with the needed items from crash cart to contamination suits and medical kits.

As the manager of your HQ it’s your job to always keep track of everything. In times of resource and time scarcity, good planning and well-considered compromises are demanded.

Show that you got what it takes to successfully complete multidisciplinary emergencies involving all three departments while keeping your crew happy and healthy. Make use of more than 20 vehicles including helicopters, tons of different equipment, skills and items to set up your rescue masterpiece.

More about UBOAT (from Steam):

UBOAT
UBOAT is a simulator of a submarine from WWII era, yet different than all you have seen so far. It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.

In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish.

Survival
The extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others.

While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships.

Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer.

Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen.

If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts.

Kriegsmarine career

During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems.

Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances.

Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds.
Receive additional permissions for the reputation points.
Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more.
Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies.
Accurate simulation

Game's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit.

Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game.

Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!

More about King of Retail (from Steam):

King of Retail is a store management simulation game, where you as the owner of a new store must make the right decisions to make your store thrive and bring you the big bucks. Can you handle the pressure, or will you fail miserably in a big bankruptcy?

As the owner and manager you have a lot of responsibilities on a daily basis.

You must:

Choose the direction of your store

Should it be a Shoe Store for the fashionable type, an Electronics Store for your everyday needs, or a giant Hypermarket that sells a bit of everything? Not everything will work. Trying to sell high-fashion, high-priced items in the poor part of town will not generate endless queues at your register. Will you try to dominate a competitive market, or go in an unexplored direction.

Control the article flow

For an article to be taken home by a customer, a lot of things must be taken care of. First you must select and order the articles. For a delivery to take place, the storage space must be able to receive and handle the delivered articles. The sales area must have the right displays and registers to showcase and sell the articles. Building a good relationship with your suppliers is key to be able to sell their more exclusive items. Oh, and by the way, which article should be the first for your customers to see when they enter your store? The bulk selling jeans, or the hyped silk shirt?

Get people inside your store

Build your reputation among your customers, and make your store the most sought after in town. A good marketing scheme, along with happy customers will work wonders for your income. But don't oversell your idea. If you can't keep what you promise, the customers will leave the store dissatisfied, and nothing ruins a store quicker than unhappy customers.

Please the customer

Create an enjoyable atmosphere for your customers to shop in, and theme your store, so they will know it is YOUR store they have entered. Make sure they receive the help they need, and that the lines for the registers don't grow too long. Manage the in-store marketing, so that both the fashionistas and the discount-hunters knows where to go, and which article to pick.

Manage your personnel

When you have too much on your plate to handle yourself, it might be the time for you to get some staff. Find interesting candidates among the applications. Conduct interviews, get a feel for the person, and decide if they match the role you need taken care of. Negotiate their salary and hire them.

Keep them happy, and make sure they are not overworked. A great working climate gives great dedication. But you still need to sort the slackers from the workers. Invest time in the right persons, and train them to become better so when you need a stand-in for yourself, when you move to the next store, you can pick from your own home-grown talents.

Optimize the store

The difference between a good store and a great store lies in the detail. Weed out the poor selling articles, and get more of the good ones. Make sure you don't order unnecessarily many articles, but still enough that you don't run out. Optimize the prizes to increase the income. Find the customer patterns and adjust the opening hours accordingly. Plan an efficient staff schedule, so you don't pay people for doing nothing.
Prepare for big events

Is a VIP coming? Christmas soon? Black Friday? Can you spot the next big trend before anyone else? Adjust your actions according to the events occurring in a dynamic city that changes day by day.

All of this is is just an ordinary day as a store owner.

Are you ready to take on the challenge? If yes, then King of Retail is the game for you.

More about Tavern Tycoon - Dragon's Hangover (from Steam):

By word, by book, the tales of the brave and mighty are told in reverie. Every warrior is remembered, his stories spreading like a magician’s flame. But, what happens after the story? Where does the hero go after slaying the dragon, rescuing the damsel and freeing the people from an untold terror? No one really knows what happens to the old and retired soldiers. They listen of course, to the very far fetched stories that are passed down from mouth to mouth. Where? In the very taverns that are bustling with legends and the young at heart.

After years of roaming free, slaying evil and merrymaking in halls of drink, everyone takes an arrow to the knee. They have obligations and duties but most of all, the retired life is boring and redundant. They miss the dangers and wish they were young again. What better way to relive the life than to run a tavern? Travellers and adventurers from all kingdoms, far and wide come aspiring for fame and glory. They tell tales of their adventures, transforming cotton tails to horrendous beasts, morphing storms to witchery! All the danger relived in safety because at the end of the day, the warmth still burns in the fireplace.

Your job is to run the tavern - Dragon's Hangover. Some will seek drinks and food while some might seek the warmth of a bed. Manage your tavern and be the host that all adventurers admire. Your journey, as the tavern's keep, begins now.

More about Fantasy Blacksmith (from Steam):

You are a blacksmith in the world of the sword, magic and war, in which any blacksmith who knows how to make even the simplest swords is in demand. You start off as a poor unskilled blacksmith, but in time you will gain experience and improve to achieve wealth, fame and power, and change this world!

Fantasy Blacksmith is a magically realistic blacksmith simulator in which you have to create and sell weapons. Also, your smith will gain more experience and become stronger and more accurate with each created sword. You can also improve your equipment in the smithy, buy a better forge, better grindstone, improve your hammer and etc. We want to create an exciting and interesting simulator in which any player can make his dream sword. We are developing the game and creating 3D models from scratch. From the finished content, we take the textures and effects, and then we rework most of them.

""You are a smith and you create swords!""
The creation of the sword begins with the drawing. The sword consists of 8 parts: Blade (5 parts), Cross-guard, Handle, Top. You choose the material from which the sword will be made. It can be iron, bronze, titan, tungsten, mithril, silver, gold, etc. Using the large number of options offered and your imagination, you can create a huge number of unique swords. We believe that there may be more than 10 billion different swords that you can create.

""Using a hammer, beat your ingot into a blade""
According to your drawing, you will be hammering the red-hot metal to give it the shape of a blade.

You also need to remember to keep the metal temperature high, if it cools down, you can not forge it.
""Finally I can make Damascus steel""
You will have the opportunity to practice alchemy. Using different chemical mixtures of the correct recipe, you can create a damask pattern on your sword. Depending on the proportion of the mix of the chemical elements, and on the heating and holding the mixture, the result will depend.

""Feel yourself a witch""
One of the most interesting parts of the gameplay is making a magic potion. This is a very exciting and dangerous process. Having done everything correctly you will get a new sword from the mythical material, but if you make a mistake you can spoil the sword or even destroy it.

In the game there will be a lot of ingredients for the magical boiler and by collecting everything by recipe, you will get many different potions.
""Long live runic magic""

A little more about Jet Ant (from Steam): An awesome side scrolling ant adventure! Take your lil' ant friend in his jet-propelled bathtub through 2 lengthy levels and dodge common household ""dangers"" that are normal to us but deadly to ants.

More about Inch by Inch (from Steam): You play a shrinking scientist in a race against time: Can you find all necessary formulas and ingredients to produce the antidote and stop shrinking, before you are too small to operate the life-saving lab equipment?

To win, collect all three key ingredients and place them inside the antidote processor. When you shrink too small, the game is over!

More on Yanpai Simulator: It's time to get a girlfriend, or at least be able to declare that you have been noticed!

This game is pure insanity and was developed by Caffeine, YanpaiDev, and published by Cheesecake."
