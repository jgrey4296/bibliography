"rLr5kSrGtEo","Let's Play ""Baldur's Gate"" Part 001 - Choppy Mouse Movements, Ho!","aulddragon","2011-08-16","2011-08-16","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLr5kSrGtEo/hqdefault.jpg","Let's Play the first of the Infinity Engine AD&D games: ""Baldur's Gate""!

We start out with character creation, which I don't go into as much depth as I did in the SSI games. To speed everything up, I pregenerated Elmindreda, the character I will be using in BG.

Unfortunately, mouse laggyness and video problems in episode 2 get the better of me. Looks like I'll have to investigate some other recording methods besides Camstudio (which works fine for old games, but not so much for newer ones). Hopefully I'll get everything worked out this weekend and I can get some more episodes done for next week."

After equipping myself at the Inn, I speak with some of the people within Candlekeep. In two empty buildings, people try to kill me!  What could be going on?!

I'm using Fraps, which works a lot better for this than Camstudio. However, the files are uncompressed, so I'll probably continue to use Camstudio for other recordings."

We finally decide to help Minsc save his ward, and so head off to the Gnoll Fortress. The journey is long (hahaha, okay, it's not) and hard (Ohnoes, Xvarts! Whatever shall I do! Maybe... kill them all? sounds good to me!), but we finally make it!"

We continue to explore the labyrinthine catacombs beneath the halfling village, and encounter some Ghost Knights of Massive Slowdown, which leads to a random unintentional quest completion! Then we encounter the one who masterminded the harassing of the village, and leads to another random unintentional quest completion!
