This time it's 1992, and Wolfenstein 3-D is trying to be a modern adaptation of a retro title but with modern sensibilities.  IT'S ALMOST LIKE TIME IS CYCLICAL

Children of DOOM finally reaches... well, DOOM.  From here on out, we'll *actually* be talking about the games impacted by this one!  Cool, huh?


Anyways, this one's a little different.  It's hard to cover a game that's been covered to death.  So I kind of go all subjective on this one, much to the chagrin of... pretty much everyone, including me."

Also, for the love of god, please let us not get into a debate about how to pronounce ""Durandal.""

Also it's a video essay.

About GoldenEye 007. And, I guess, game inputs. And James Bond. And 1997. It's about a lot of things. Because again, I am a man in desperate need of someone to edit him.

It's weird to have watched this series change: what started as a time filler in between ""bigger"" essays has itself become one of the biggest projects in scope I've ever done.  And what started as talking about one game each year has slowly become more and more about looking about each year in context and cross-comparing what was going on.  I think this is more useful and interesting, but it is also undeniably more resource and time intensive to produce.  Hopefully the results continue to bear fruit, though.
